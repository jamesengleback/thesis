The role of dynamic conformational ensembles in 
biomolecular recognition
David D Boehr1, Ruth Nussinov2,3 & Peter E Wright4

Molecular recognition is central to all biological processes.  
For the past 50 years, Koshland’s ‘induced fit’ hypothesis has 
been the textbook explanation for molecular recognition 
events. However, recent experimental evidence supports an 
alternative mechanism. ‘Conformational selection’ postulates 
that all protein conformations pre-exist, and the ligand 
selects the most favored conformation. Following binding 
the ensemble undergoes a population shift, redistributing the 
conformational states. Both conformational selection and 
induced fit appear to play roles. Following binding by a primary 
conformational selection event, optimization of side chain and 
backbone interactions is likely to proceed by an induced fit 
mechanism. Conformational selection has been observed for 
protein-ligand, protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA and 
RNA-ligand interactions. These data support a new molecular 
recognition paradigm for processes as diverse as signaling, 
catalysis, gene regulation and protein aggregation in disease, 
which has the potential to significantly impact our views 
and strategies in drug design, biomolecular engineering and 
molecular evolution.

Highly specific and tightly regulated interactions between biological 
macromolecules are at the basis of all processes in living organisms. 
An understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of molecular rec-
ognition is therefore central to understanding biology at the molecular 
level. The two textbook mechanistic explanations for molecular rec-
ognition are Fischer’s ‘lock-and-key’ model1 and Koshland’s ‘induced 
fit’ hypothesis2. In the ‘lock-and-key’ model, the conformations of 
the free and ligand-bound protein are essentially the same, whereas 
‘induced fit’ posits that conformational differences between these two 
states are the result of the binding interaction driving the protein 
toward a new conformation that is more complementary to its bind-
ing partner. In their simplest forms, both the lock-and-key and the 
induced fit models treat the protein as if it exists in a single, stable con-
formation under given experimental conditions. However, proteins

are inherently dynamic and sample a vast ensemble of conformations. 
Thus, thermally accessible conformational substates other than the 
‘native’ (that is, lowest energy) conformation may play important 
roles in molecular recognition3 (see Fig. 1). The alternative model of 
conformational selection takes into account this conformational het-
erogeneity and argues that weakly populated, higher energy confor-
mations are responsible for recognizing and binding to partners with 
subsequent population shift toward these conformers4–6. Invoked by 
kinetic data to explain antigen recognition and antibody specificity7–10  
and generalized to apply to all binding events, the conformational 
selection and population shift model4–6,11 challenges the assump-
tion that conformational differences between free and ligand-bound 
protein automatically implicate an induced fit–type mechanism of 
molecular recognition. Given the impact that the 50-year-old induced 
fit hypothesis has had on chemistry and biology and the central role 
of molecular recognition in all biological processes, an alternative to 
this decades-old theory based on fundamental physical principles 
deserves careful consideration.

The  conformational  selection  model  derives  from  the  energy 
landscape  theory  of  protein  structure  and  dynamics3,5,11,12.  The 
energy landscape theory in biology is most familiar in terms of the 
‘protein folding funnel’3,5,13, but it also has major consequences in 
terms of binding interactions and protein function4,5,14. A protein 
free energy landscape consists of different conformations or ‘sub-
states’  in  dynamic  equilibrium.  The  populations  of  the  substates 
follow statistical thermodynamic distributions, and the heights of 
the energy barriers separating the substates define the timescale of 
conformational exchange. If the free energy barriers are low rela-
tive to the Boltzmann energy (kBT), thermal fluctuations can lead 
to significant population of more than one conformational state in 
solution. A ligand may interact with the lowest energy conformation, 
or with one of a number of higher energy conformational substates 
that are populated in solution4,5,11. In all cases, the binding interac-
tion does not ‘induce’ a conformational change; it merely leads to a 
population shift—that is, a redistribution of the relative populations 
of conformational substates that already pre-exist in solution. Within 
this context, the lock-and-key model is a limiting case of conforma-
tional selection when the interaction partner selectively binds to the 
lowest energy conformation.

Structural  differences  between  the  ‘beginning’  (free)  and  ‘end’ 
(bound)  thermodynamic  states,  as  observed  in  X-ray  and  NMR 
structures, do not by themselves reveal the process of molecular rec-
ognition. A structural demonstration of induced fit would require 
data  sampled  over  the  entire  course  of  the  binding  interaction 
and would need to show how interaction with the binding partner 
directly leads to specific structural changes in the protein8. Structural

evidence for conformational selection would entail the characterization  
of alternative conformations in the free state that resemble the final 
ligand-bound  conformation8,  and  this  would  need  to  be  comple-
mented  by  studies  demonstrating  that  the  ligand  interacts  with  a 
small population of a ‘bound’ substate (throughout this review we 
will use the term ‘bound’ to refer to a conformational substate of 
the unliganded protein that has a conformation resembling that of 
the ligand-bound state). In the past, structural characterization of 
conformations other than the one most highly populated in solu-
tion or in the crystal has been difficult. Fortunately, single molecule, 
NMR and other spectroscopic techniques are now beginning to shed 

Box 1:  Kinetics and thermodynamics of ‘induced fit’ versus 
‘conformational selection’ 

Simple induced fit and conformational selection processes can be viewed in 
terms of a thermodynamic cycle (Fig. 1). The key difference between these 
two extreme mechanisms is that in the induced-fit model the bound protein 
conformation forms only after interaction with a binding partner, whereas in the 
conformational selection model, it pre-exists in the ensemble of conformations 
sampled by the free protein in the absence of ligand. The kinetic rate constants 
describing the thermodynamic cycle can dictate which molecular recognition 
pathway will dominate. According to this model, if the concentration of the 
higher energy ‘bound’ conformation ([P2]) is larger than the concentration of the 
induced-fit intermediate ([P1L]), conformational selection will be the preferred 
kinetic pathway99. This means that for induced fit to be operative, there must be 
some initial favorable interaction between the ligand and the protein (K1) before 
conformational change, and/or the ligand concentration needs to be sufficiently 
high. Of course, depending on the rate constants and protein/ligand  
concentrations, both recognition mechanisms may be feasible in a given  
system. In conformational selection, the rate of formation of the final bound 
complex (P2L) depends linearly on the concentration of the higher energy 
‘bound’ conformation ([P2]) and nonlinearly on the total concentration of the 
protein ([P1+P2])8. Unfortunately, if the population of the higher energy  
conformation (P2) is very low (5%), it may be difficult to kinetically distinguish 
induced fit versus conformational selection processes. It should be noted that 
the thermodynamic box as presented is an oversimplification of the binding 
process, considering that many substates within the conformation ensemble 
could have some affinity for the ligand.

more light on the true conformational diversity of proteins in solu-
tion15–19. These methods have revealed the presence of conforma-
tional substates that resemble the bound state and that form part of 
the conformational ensemble populated by the unliganded protein; 
the existence of such ‘bound’ substates had previously been inferred 
only  through  computational  protein  dynamics20–22.  Intriguingly, 
these results come from a host of molecular recognition events includ-
ing protein-ligand, protein-protein, protein-DNA and RNA-ligand 
interactions. In this Perspective, we discuss recent structural support 
for the conformational selection model and the consequences of a free 
energy landscape picture of protein structure and function in terms of 
drug design, biomolecular engineering and molecular evolution.

Conformational selection in protein-ligand interactions
The energy landscape theory was first used to describe the dynamic 
behavior of myoglobin as observed by the elegant flash photolysis 
experiments of Frauenfelder et al.3. Experiments that measured the 
kinetics of light-activated dissociation of oxygen from heme in myo-
globin  at  physiological  temperatures  suggested  a  simple  one-step 
process. However, photodissociation experiments below 200 K dem-
onstrated non-exponential kinetics23 and were rationalized by sug-
gesting that myoglobin did not have a single structure under these 
conditions, but instead was composed of many conformational sub-
states, each with slightly different rebinding rates3. Time-resolved  
X-ray diffraction24 and subnanosecond spectroscopic techniques25 
have provided detailed insights into the complex free energy land-
scape of myoglobin and other heme-containing proteins. These stud-
ies lend strong support to the notion that a protein exists not as a 
single structure, but rather as a statistical ensemble of conformations 
that can give rise to complex protein kinetics.

Although time-resolved Laue diffraction can provide a wealth of 
information about conformational heterogeneity, application of the 
method is restricted to proteins that can be photoactivated. This lim-
its the structural information that can be obtained about the confor-
mational ensembles of other proteins. Classical X-ray crystallography 
usually reveals only a single protein conformation under a given set of 
conditions. However, different protein conformations are sometimes 
observed when the same protein complex is crystallized in other space 
groups under different conditions26. Alternative conformations for dis-
tinct protein molecules in the asymmetric unit of the same crystal may 
also be observed27,28. In one noteworthy case, the monoclonal antibody 
SPE7 was crystallized in two different conformations in the absence of 
antigen. Structural analyses of the free and antigen-bound conforma-
tions suggest that each conformation is responsible for binding par-
ticular antigens29. Pre-steady state kinetics further support pre-binding 
conformational isomerism and conformational selection in the func-
tion of SPE7 (ref. 29). Similar kinetic results support conformational 
selection in other antibody-antigen interactions7,9,10,30 and in other 
types of protein interactions31–33 (see Box 1 for a kinetic and thermo-
dynamic comparison of conformational selection versus induced fit).
NMR is a powerful technique for studying conformational hetero-
geneity and the free energy landscape of macromolecules34. NMR 
provides  atomic  resolution  insights  into  both  protein  structure 
and  dynamics  over  a  large  range  of  timescales  (ps–s)  and,  unlike 
time-resolved techniques that perturb chemical and structural equi-
libria,  directly  monitors  dynamics  under  steady  state  conditions. 
Importantly,  NMR  methods  developed  over  the  past  decade  have 
allowed the structural characterization of weakly populated states 
(as  little  as  1%  population)  in  the  conformational  ensemble  that 
may play a role in the molecular recognition process34. In particular, 
relaxation dispersion techniques provide kinetic and thermodynamic

the chemical shifts of the ground-state conformation of the product 
ternary complex) (data taken from ref. 41). (c) The binding of the

information about exchange between two or more conformational 
substates on the µs–ms timescale and also provide information about 
chemical shifts in the higher energy state that can be used to char-
acterize its structure (see Fig. 2). Advances toward directly incorpo-
rating chemical shifts in NMR structure refinement35 and newer R2 
relaxation dispersion experiments that report on internuclear vector 
orientations in higher energy substates36,37 provide structural con-
straints that may allow for direct characterization of higher energy 
protein conformations38.

Conformational selection processes are implicated in a number 
of enzymes, including RNase A39, adenylate kinase27,40 and dihydro-
folate reductase41,42. The results with adenylate kinase are especially 
significant since this enzyme has been used as a textbook example for 
induced fit. NMR analyses of mesophilic (Escherichia coli) and ther-
mophilic (Aquifex aeolicus) adenylate kinases are consistent with two-
state conformational exchange between the open and closed states 
observed in X-ray crystal structures of free and ligand-bound adenyl-
ate kinase, respectively27,40. Chemical shift values from R2 relaxation 
dispersion experiments (∆ω) obtained during catalytic turnover show 
a strong linear correlation between the chemical shift differences (∆δ) 
between the open and closed conformational states. Moreover, there is 
a strong correlation between the lid opening rates (44 s−1 and 286 s−1 
for E. coli and A. aeolicus, respectively) measured by R2 relaxation 
dispersion and catalytic turnover (kcat = 30 s−1 and 263 s−1 for E. coli 
and A. aeolicus, respectively)40. These results suggest that both adenyl-
ate kinases fluctuate between open and closed conformations during 
catalysis, and that product release depends on the closed-to-open 
conformational transition. Conformational exchange between open 
and closed conformations is not solely the function of catalytic turn-
over considering that similar motions are also observed in the free 
enzyme27. In the crystal structure of the free A. aeolicus enzyme, there 
are three molecules in the asymmetric unit, each with a slightly dif-
ferent conformation27. These conformations lie along the trajectory 
between fully open and fully closed conformations27. Moreover, R2 
relaxation dispersion NMR spectroscopy, single-molecule FRET and 
paramagnetic NMR relaxation experiments are all consistent with 
the fluctuation of the enzyme into a ‘bound’ conformation in the 
absence of substrate27,43.

In the case of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), the dynamics of 
five different complexes, representing all the intermediates formed in 
the catalytic cycle, were measured using NMR relaxation dispersion 
techniques41,42. The conformational dynamics of DHFR are ligand 
dependent, in marked contrast to the ligand-independent fluctuations 
observed in other proteins27,44. The binary complexes, with cofactor 

or product bound, both fluctuate into conformations resembling the 
ternary complex (that is, bound with both cofactor and substrate or 
product), as suggested by the linear correlation between the dynamic 
chemical shift differences between lowest and higher energy confor-
mations for the binary complexes (∆ωbinary) and the ground-state 
chemical shift differences between the binary and ternary complexes 
(∆δ (binary-ternary))41 (Fig. 2). Single-molecule experiments also 
support the fluctuation of DHFR into other conformations in the 
presence of substrate or cofactor that may assist binding of the second 
ligand45. The dynamics observed in complexes of DHFR appear to be 
functionally relevant in that each complex fluctuates into a conforma-
tion resembling the next and/or previous step in the catalytic cycle41. 
Thus,  population  re-distributions,  mediated  by  the  interactions 
between enzyme and ligands, play roles in substrate binding, product 
release and catalytic turnover. This suggests that the free energy land-
scape of E. coli DHFR is dynamic11, in the sense that ligand binding 
(or release) can alter the nature of the thermally accessible substates 
in the conformational ensemble and the kinetic and thermodynamic 
parameters governing the conformational equilibria41,46–48.

Conformational selection in protein interactions
Studies of enzyme-substrate and enzyme-product complexes dem-
onstrate that proteins can fluctuate into conformations that resem-
ble those of the bound state, even in the absence of ligand. These 
results  and  others49–54  provide  structural  support  for  conforma-
tional selection in molecular recognition between proteins and small 
molecules. Similar experimental support exists for conformational 
selection mechanisms in protein-protein55–60 and protein–nucleic 
acid interactions61–63.

NMR  provides  a  number  of  observables,  other  than  relaxation 
dispersion, that are used to gain insights into the nature of the con-
formational  ensemble.  An  especially  powerful  approach  is  to  use 
NMR observables as restraints in molecular dynamic simulations, 
or alternatively, NMR observables can be used to bias populations of 
pre-generated conformations representing potential substates within 
the conformational ensemble (for more comprehensive discussion 
of the methodology, see reviews64–66 and references therein). In one 
approach,  NMR  order  parameters  and  nuclear  Overhauser  effects 
(NOEs) were used to characterize the conformational ensembles of 
ubiquitin67 and calmodulin55. NOEs are commonly used as restraints 
in  NMR  structure  determination,  while  Lipari-Szabo  order  para-
meters (S2)68 give an indication of the amplitude of protein motion 
on  a  ps–ns  timescale.  Intriguingly,  the  calculated  conformational 
ensemble of Ca2+-calmodulin includes structures that are very similar

Figure 3  A schematic illustration of molecular recognition processes 
involving ubiquitin. The NMR-derived conformational ensemble of 
ubiquitin indicates that all ‘bound’ conformations exist in the absence of 
protein binding partners66 (left). Although the conformational ensemble 
encompasses all 46 of the known crystal structures of ubiquitin, only 5 
are shown here for clarity (PDB 1F9J, 1S1Q, 1XD3, 2D36 and 2G45). 
The free energy landscapes are hypothetical considering that the relative 
population of each conformation in the ensemble and the energy barriers 
separating the conformations are not known.

to  the  conformation  of  calmodulin  bound  to  myosin  light  chain 
kinase55. Calmodulin consists of N-terminal and C-terminal domains 
 separated by an interdomain linker. The NMR-derived conformational 
ensemble of Ca2+-calmodulin suggests that the unliganded C-termi-
nal domain adopts a ‘bound’ conformation much more frequently 
than does the unliganded N-terminal domain. Based on these results 
and other biophysical evidence55, the authors postulate a molecular 
recognition process in which myosin light chain kinase first interacts 
with the C-terminal domain, followed by population shifts within the 
conformational ensemble such that the ‘bound’ conformations of the 
N-terminal domain become more populated55. Although a multistep 
process, the mechanism of binding involves shifting of populations 
within an ensemble of pre-existing conformations4–6,8,11 rather than 
‘induction’ of a new conformation not observed in the free protein. 
Recent single-molecule atomic force microscopy experiments further 
support a population shift mechanism for myosin light chain kinase 
binding to Ca2+-calmodulin57.

One shortcoming of the classical Lipari-Szabo NMR order para-
meters is that they only report on ps–ns timescale protein dynamics 
and therefore do not give information about dynamic processes on 
slower timescales that might also be relevant for molecular recogni-
tion. Newer approaches utilize structural data from residual dipolar 
couplings (RDCs)65 and/or paramagnetic relaxation enhancement 
(PRE)66 to characterize conformational ensembles on slower time-
scales. For example, RDCs that report on internuclear vector ori-
entations can be used both in NMR structure determination and to 
identify protein motions on the ps–ms timescale65,69. Thus, RDC-
derived  order  parameters  that  are  smaller  in  magnitude  than  the 
Lipari-Szabo  order  parameters  suggest  additional  motions  on  the 
ns–ms timescale that are not captured by the classical order para-
meters. By measuring RDCs resulting from partial alignment in a 
large number of media, the conformational ensemble of ubiquitin 
was calculated up to the microsecond timescale60. The most striking 
feature of the conformational ensemble is the presence of ‘bound’ 
conformations in the free state of ubiquitin (Fig. 3). In fact, the back-
bone conformations in all 46 of the known X-ray crystal structures of 
ubiquitin in complex with various partner proteins are represented 
within the conformational ensemble, despite the absence of any crys-
tallographic information in ensemble refinement60. This gives strong 
evidence that ‘bound’ conformations of ubiquitin are present in the 
free protein, in the absence of protein interaction partners, and that 
conformational selection-type processes are important for molecu-
lar recognition in ubiquitin. However, subsequent conformational 
changes may be induced, especially in the side chains, after the initial 
binding interaction60. Kinetic studies implicate conformational selec-
tion in Alzheimer’s Aβ amyloidosis70, which can also be considered a 
protein-protein recognition event71.

Conformational selection in RNA and DNA interactions
The  principles  of  energy  landscape  theory  can  also  be  applied  to 
protein–nucleic acid recognition and to the structure and dynamics 
of RNA and DNA63,72. For example, the specificity of lac repressor

headpiece binding to DNA can be explained by describing differences 
in the protein free energy landscape when bound to either cognate 
or noncognate DNA61,72. NMR studies indicate that there are both 
structural  and  dynamic  differences  between  noncognate  and  cog-
nate DNA–lac repressor complexes61 (Fig. 4). Protein motions on the 
µs–ms timescale that are observed in the DNA-free lac repressor head-
piece are significantly increased when it binds to nonspecific DNA, 
especially for residues at the protein-DNA interface61. However, upon 
binding the cognate DNA sequence, the µs–ms timescale motions 
observed by NMR are effectively quenched61. Many of the residues 
that display changes in µs–ms timescale dynamics adopt alternative 
conformations in the NMR-derived structural ensemble of the non-
specific complex61. Together, these results suggest that the lac repressor  
headpiece samples many conformations in the DNA-free form and 
when bound to nonspecific DNA, but that a single protein conforma-
tion is selected when the protein binds to its specific DNA recognition 
sequence61,72. The molecular recognition mechanism described for 
the lac repressor would allow the protein to bind initially to non-
specific DNA and allow for a fast one-dimensional diffusional search 
for the cognate recognition site73,74, while also providing a mechanism 
for tight binding with the target sequence.

The  structural  and  dynamic  diversity  of  RNA  rivals  that  of 
 proteins63. Many RNA molecules also exist as conformational ensem-
bles containing interconverting substates, and binding interactions 
can be rationalized based on population shifts and conformational 
selection processes63. For example, the RDC-derived dynamics of the 
transactivation response (TAR) RNA from the human immunodefi-
ciency virus type-1 demonstrate that the RNA samples ‘bound’ con-
formations even in the absence of ligand75. The motions of the two 
TAR RNA helices appear to be highly correlated, and they trace out 
a dynamic trajectory that encompasses the conformations observed 
in nearly all of the ligand-bound structures75. Thus, conformational 
selection appears to be universal in molecular recognition processes 
involving biomolecules.

Conformational selection in protein regulation
Conformational selection is closely related to the Monod-zWyman-
Changeux  (MWC)  theory  of  allostery76.  The  MWC  theory  also

For example, the enzyme aspartate transcarbamoylase is suggested 
to exist in two conformations: a fully active R state and a less active 
T state77. Although the crystal structures of the R and T states of 
aspartate transcarbamoylase are well characterized, only recently has 
it been possible to detect both conformations in solution by NMR and 
to directly monitor the population redistributions upon the addi-
tion of allosteric ligands78,79. Results from the NMR studies are fully 
consistent with the MWC model.

Population redistributions of active and inactive protein conforma-
tions can also explain other regulatory processes80. Phosphorylation 
of the bacterial signaling protein NtrC leads to a large conformational 
change81. NMR studies demonstrate that unphosphorylated NtrC 
accesses a conformation similar to that of phosphorylated Ntrc, which 
suggests that phosphorylation results in a population redistribution 
between active and inactive conformations that pre-exist in solution81. 
Likewise, NMR relaxation dispersion experiments demonstrate that 
the photoswitch LOV2-Jα fluctuates between ‘dark’ inactive and ‘light’ 
active conformations82. Shining light on the protein results in a popu-
lation redistribution that favors the active conformational substate. 
Thus, changes in protein populations represent a general mechanism 
for protein function that interconnects molecular recognition and 
protein regulation.

Implications and future directions
The studies described above clearly indicate that proteins and RNA 
can access ‘bound’ conformations even in the absence of a binding 
partner.  However,  the  mere  fact  that  the ‘bound’  conformation  is 
present in the ensemble of conformations sampled by the free pro-
tein does not in itself implicate this conformation in the recognition 
process. The Dbl homology (DH) domain of the oncoprotein Vav1 
provides a striking example of the role of a higher energy confor-
mational substate in biological function83. NMR relaxation disper-
sion experiments show that the DH domain fluctuates between a 
ground-state conformation, in which an autoinhibitory helix binds 
to and blocks the active site, and a weakly populated higher energy 
conformation in which the autoinhibitory helix is dissociated from 
the catalytic surface83. Mutations that alter the equilibrium distribu-
tions of the two states change the catalytic activity of the DH domain 
and the rate of phosphorylation of the autoinhibitory helix by the Lck 
kinase; the catalytic activity and the phosphorylation rate are linearly 
dependent on the population of the higher energy ‘helix dissociated’ 
conformation83.

Although  in  the  preceding  sections  we  emphasized  the  impor-
tance of conformational selection mechanisms, it is likely that both 
conformational  selection  and  induced  fit  play  important  roles  in 
molecular recognition. Following initial binding through a conforma-
tional selection mechanism, it is probable that further changes to the 

 protein structure and underlying free energy landscape are required 
to  optimize  the  intermolecular  interactions;  such  conformational 
 rearrangements constitute an induced fit process. The co-existence 
of both mechanisms is evident in interactions of the maltose-binding 
protein. The ligand-free protein fluctuates between a predominantly 
open  form  and  a  minor  partially  closed  species49.  Maltose  could 
potentially interact with both conformations, but further structural 
changes would need to take place to form the final ligand-bound, fully 
closed conformation49.

The energy landscape view of protein folding and function has 
numerous practical consequences in areas such as drug design, protein 
engineering and molecular evolution. For example, small-molecule 
inhibitors can be designed against higher energy conformations pres-
ent in the conformational ensemble to target different conformations 
of the binding pocket84–86. Along these lines, several molecular dock-
ing procedures have previously been designed to account for protein 
flexibility in molecular recognition86–89. In one procedure, a con-
formational ensemble is pre-generated using experimental informa-
tion (for example, different X-ray crystal structures or NMR-derived 
conformational ensembles) and/or computational data (for example, 
molecular dynamics simulations, normal mode analyses, principal 
component analyses); similar conformations are clustered, and bind-
ing partners are then docked to representative target conformations88. 
Further energy minimization procedures and/or molecular dynamics 
simulations can account for additional small-scale motions in the 
interaction complex. The two stages of the procedure (initial dock-
ing of the conformational ensemble, followed by refinement and/or 
molecular dynamics) essentially represent conformational selection 
and induced fit processes, respectively. However, a large hurdle in 
accounting for protein target flexibility in the docking procedure is 
the increased computation time. The experimental information pre-
sented in this review suggests that low-lying conformational substates 
are primarily responsible for molecular recognition; consequently, 
biased docking to highly populated conformational clusters (that is, 
the lowest energy conformational substates) may significantly dimin-
ish the computational time. Experimental techniques such as those 
described here can be used to further decrease the size of the confor-
mational ensemble required for docking.

Nonetheless, applying energy landscape theory to drug design is not 
straightforward. Not all conformations in the ensemble are likely to 
be equally ‘druggable’; this reflects key differences in energetics and/or 
accessibility of the potential binding pocket in different members of 
the conformational ensemble. In such cases, enhanced exploration of 
the conformational space of the target through additional computa-
tional procedures may be required86. An alternative strategy for incor-
porating the conformational ensemble in drug design is the search for

allosteric inhibitors (or activators) that would alter the distribution of 
the conformational ensemble. Though considerable progress has been 
made toward this goal90, and allosteric drugs are already in the mar-
ket or are currently under development85, unfortunately, no general 
strategy is currently available for developing allosteric inhibitors to 
interact with binding pockets that exist only in a subset of substates 
in the conformational ensemble. A better understanding of protein 
dynamics  and  the  role  of  conformational  entropy  in  determining 
inhibitor  binding  affinity  is  urgently  required.  The  complexity  of 
the interactions that determine the overall binding affinity is evident 
from recent studies of calmodulin, which show clearly that changes in 
protein dynamics before and after peptide binding have a significant 
entropic effect on peptide binding affinity91. Thus, the notion that 
higher affinity binding always results in a more stable, rigid complex 
may not be entirely correct, and attention must also be paid to the 
nature of the conformational ensemble populated by the protein in 
the ligand-bound state.

Considerations of conformational heterogeneity and conforma-
tional selection could potentially aid greatly in the design of pro-
tein function and engineering of enzymes92,93. Despite impressive 
successes,  initial  attempts  to  design  artificial  enzymes  resulted  in 
relatively poor catalysts, compared to naturally occurring enzymes. 
Similarly, catalytic antibodies raised against transition-state analogs 
are also inefficient catalysts, in general, compared to their natural 
enzyme counterparts94. This suggests that either we do not have a firm 
enough understanding of the chemistry and transition-state com-
plexes involved, or that we ignore and do not select for other critical 
parameters  that  are  essential  for  efficient  enzyme  catalysis.  In  the 
case of one newly engineered enzyme, in vitro evolution was able to 
select for catalysts with activities similar to those of naturally occur-
ring enzymes92. Although this result argues that a combined compu-
tational design and directed evolution approach can yield effective 
biocatalysts, not all mutations introduced by in vitro evolution can be 
readily explained. Current enzyme design efforts tend to consider only 
the chemical steps in an enzyme’s catalytic cycle, overlooking essential 
steps such as substrate binding, product release and conformational 
change that could severely limit the catalytic turnover rate in a natural 
enzyme. Studies of enzymes such as dihydrofolate reductase41, adenyl-
ate kinase27 and RNase A39 suggest that conformational selection-type 
processes occur throughout the catalytic cycle and can govern steady 
state turnover41. Hence, we argue that in the future, consideration 
of low-lying conformational ensembles and conformational changes 
(that is, re-distribution of the conformer populations) in parallel with 
optimization of chemistry, substrate binding and product release will 
be essential for the design of more effective catalysts that rival natu-
rally occurring enzymes in catalytic activity. Incorporation of such 
elements into the design strategy could also permit the engineering of 
regulatory elements that modify newly evolved enzyme activities via 
remote-site allosteric modulation. In turn, these studies will enhance 
comprehension of conformational ensembles in ligand interactions, 
enzyme catalysis and molecular evolution.

Conformational ensembles are also important in the evolution of 
molecular interactions. The ‘bound’ conformation observed in free 
enzymes such as adenylate kinase and dihydrofolate reductase can 
be regarded as the second most highly populated conformation in 
solution; other conformations even higher in energy and of much 
lower population are not detectable by NMR relaxation dispersion 
techniques. This suggests that the intrinsic fluctuations of a protein 
(or RNA) are highly ‘tuned’ and have evolved to be functionally rel-
evant84,  and  that  it  is  the  lowest  energy  subset  of  conformational 
states that are most relevant to biological function. In the case of 

ubiquitin, the conformational ensemble contains a very large num-
ber of different conformational substates; these may have evolved to 
allow ubiquitin to interact with a diverse range of binding partners, or 
conversely, protein binding partners may have taken advantage of pre-
existing conformational diversity. Both processes may be important 
in  the  evolution  of  molecular  recognition.  This  is  similar  to  a  
70-year-old proposal for antigen-antibody interactions that suggested 
that both conformational and amino acid sequence diversity would 
allow antibodies to interact with the greatest variety of antigens95. 
Darwinian evolution requires that a function exists to some extent 
before  natural  selection6,11,  thus  protein  conformational  diversity 
and functional promiscuity are closely connected and are a potential 
means of molecular evolution96,97. Conformational selection pro-
cesses may also be more resilient to evolutionary forces than induced 
fit–type  mechanisms11.  In  the  case  of  conformational  selection, 
deleterious mutations may significantly alter the free energy land-
scape, but binding-competent conformers may still be present in the 
conformational ensemble. This is in contrast to an induced fit–type 
mechanism  where  an  unfavorable  mutation  can  critically  disrupt 
the step-wise conformational changes required for competent bind-
ing11. Except for a few studies of the maturation process of antibody- 
antigen interactions7,29,98, there is very little information regarding 
the role of the conformational ensemble in directing molecular evo-
lution. This situation is unfortunate, since a better understanding of 
the evolutionary aspects of conformational heterogeneity could have 
an immediate and positive impact on efforts to design and engineer  
de novo proteins with new functions.
