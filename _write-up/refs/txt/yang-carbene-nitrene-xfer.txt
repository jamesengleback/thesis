CONSPECTUS: Despite the astonishing diversity of naturally occurring biocatalytic
processes, enzymes do not catalyze many of the transformations favored by synthetic
chemists. Either nature does not care about the speciﬁc products, or if she does, she has
adopted a diﬀerent synthetic strategy. In many cases, the appropriate reagents used by
synthetic chemists are not readily accessible to biological systems. Here, we discuss our
eﬀorts to expand the catalytic repertoire of enzymes to encompass powerful reactions
previously known only in small-molecule catalysis: formation and transfer of reactive
carbene and nitrene intermediates leading to a broad range of products,
including
products with bonds not known in biology. In light of the structural similarity of iron
carbene (FeC(R1)(R2)) and iron nitrene (FeNR) to the iron oxo (FeO)
intermediate involved in cytochrome P450-catalyzed oxidation, we have used synthetic
carbene and nitrene precursors that biological systems have not encountered and
repurposed P450s to catalyze reactions that are not known in the natural world. The
resulting protein catalysts are fully genetically encoded and function in intact microbial cells or cell-free lysates, where their
performance can be improved and optimized by directed evolution. By leveraging the catalytic promiscuity of P450 enzymes, we
evolved a range of carbene and nitrene transferases exhibiting excellent activity toward these new-to-nature reactions. Since our
initial report in 2012, a number of other heme proteins including myoglobins, protoglobins, and cytochromes c have also been found
and engineered to promote unnatural carbene and nitrene transfer. Due to the altered active-site environments, these heme proteins
often displayed complementary activities and selectivities to P450s.
Using wild-type and engineered heme proteins, we and others have described a range of selective carbene transfer reactions,
including cyclopropanation, cyclopropenation, Si−H insertion, B−H insertion, and C−H insertion. Similarly, a variety of asymmetric
nitrene transfer processes including aziridination, sulﬁde imidation, C−H amidation, and, most recently, C−H amination have been
demonstrated. The scopes of these biocatalytic carbene and nitrene transfer reactions are often complementary to the state-of-the-art
processes based on small-molecule transition-metal catalysts, making engineered biocatalysts a valuable addition to the synthetic
chemist’s toolbox. Moreover, enabled by the exquisite regio- and stereocontrol imposed by the enzyme catalyst, this biocatalytic
platform provides an exciting opportunity to address challenging problems in modern synthetic chemistry and selective catalysis,
including ones that have eluded synthetic chemists for decades.

■ INTRODUCTION
Nature’s malleable protein catalysts, enzymes, are capable of
facilitating highly demanding transformations with exquisite
control.5−7 A signiﬁcant fraction of enzymes assemble and
exploit metal ions for catalysis. These metalloenzymes catalyze
some of the most challenging biological reactions, including
photosynthesis,8 nitrogen ﬁxation,9 methane oxidation10 and
methylmalonyl-CoA isomerization,11 with unique reactivity not
observed in small-molecule organometallic complexes or
enzymes based on purely organic cofactors.

Our laboratory has been fascinated by enzymes of the iron-
containing cytochromes P450 (CYPs) family for decades. P450s
constitute a subset of hemoproteins using the heme prosthetic
group for their native functions.12,13 Found in all kingdoms of
life, P450s catalyze extraordinary oxygenation reactions under
exceptionally mild conditions.14−16 In these P450-catalyzed
oxidation reactions, a Fe(IV)O porphyrin radical cation
species (compound I) is the key oxidizing intermediate for
oxene transfer reactions.17 Nature has tamed this intermediate
and diversiﬁed its reactivity for a vast array of oxidative
transformations.

Using P450BM3 from Bacillus megaterium (CYP102A1),18 a
self-suﬃcient P450 naturally fused to its diﬂavin redox partner,
our group19−23 and others12,18,24,25 have engineered highly
active P450 variants for the oxidation of simple alkanes and
other organic substrates (Scheme 1). Starting a decade ago, our

the structural similarity between these synthetic Fe carbenes and
Fe nitrenes and the native Fe oxene (compound I), we thought
we should be able to generate Fe carbene and nitrene
intermediates in P450s by exploiting synthetic precursors not
present in nature (Scheme 2). Furthermore, we posited that the

selective transfer of these reactive species to organic substrates
within the enzyme active site would lead to a similarly broad
spectrum of synthetically useful transformations.

In 2012 and 2013, we described repurposing P450s for new-
to-nature carbene and nitrene transfer reactions.1,37 Since then, a
plethora of biocatalytic stereoselective C−C, C−N, C−Si, and
C−B bond forming processes, including ones that are diﬃcult or
impossible to achieve with current small-molecule catalysts,
have been developed by us and by other research groups who
have joined this exciting journey of discovery. In this Account,
we survey the evolution of heme proteins for non-natural
carbene and nitrene transfer reactions in our lab. We also present
the conceptual advances and strategies that were pivotal to this
development.

TRANSFER: INITIAL DISCOVERY

group became interested in expanding the already immense
catalytic repertoire of P450s to encompass reactions not known
in the biological world. Inspiration came from two sources: (1)
Evolution does itnew activities arose during P450 evolution,
and there was no reason to think that further innovation was not
possible using evolutionary engineering methods. (2) Creative
chemists had already shown that the heme cofactor and various
derivatives can catalyze reactions not known in nature.26−29 We
reasoned that some of these should be available to the heme
cofactor embedded in a protein, and that directed evolution
could be used to draw out these latent functions.
Of special interest to us were the myriad carbene30−33 and
nitrene34−36 transfer reactions that synthetic chemists had
developed. Metal porphyrin complexes,26,27 including Fe
porphyrins, are privileged catalysts for such transformations.
As the vital intermediates in these metalloporphyrin-catalyzed
processes, metal carbenes and nitrenes supported by the
porphyrin ligand have been extensively investigated. In light of

At the outset of our eﬀorts to create new-to-nature enzymes,
designing an enzyme to catalyze a new reaction, especially one
that is unknown in biochemistry, was widely regarded as a
formidable challenge. After all, building a new active site requires
placement of multiple functional groups in a binding pocket that
can orient substrate(s) and stabilize one or more transition
states, depending on the reaction. Designing enzymes de novo
was (and still is) notoriously diﬃcult, and it was not clear how a
conservative process of directed evolution, one mutation at a
time, could create catalytic novelty.

However, evolution has done it countless times. Less
appreciated perhaps by the admirers of enzymes’ speciﬁcity
and selectivity is the fact that many enzymes are also catalytically
“promiscuous”:38−40 they are capable of catalyzing, at some
level, chemical reactions unrelated to their biological functions.
In the history of evolution, this promiscuity has played a central
role in the emergence of new biological functions.41 In recent
years,
the signiﬁcance of catalytic promiscuity has been
increasingly recognized, and the structural, mechanistic, and
evolutionary implications of catalytic promiscuity are being

elucidated.42,43 Inspired by nature’s strategy, we sought to
harness promiscuity to discover new enzyme chemistries,
especially ones that are synthetically useful and challenging to
achieve with small-molecule catalysts. In this context, the
demonstrable promiscuity of P450s originating from their
structural ﬂexibility44 makes them excellent candidates for
discovery of new-to-nature activities.

For our initial study, we focused on enantioselective
cyclopropanation of alkenes. An enantioenriched, polysubsti-
tuted cyclopropane is a common structural element in a variety
of medicinal agents. More importantly, Woo previously showed
that Fe porphyrin complexes could catalyze such trans-
formations in a racemic fashion.45 We discovered that various
including myoglobin and cytochrome c,
heme proteins,
exhibited the desired activity, but a large in-house collection of
P450BM3 variants accumulated during our research on P450
oxygenation proved instrumental to showing that selectivity and
activity were readily tunable by protein engineering. Upon
evaluating a panel of P450BM3 variants, we found that several
displayed dramatically enhanced cyclopropanation activity
relative to hemin in water, as well as promising enantioselectivity
and complementary diastereoselectivity (Scheme 3).1 Speciﬁ-

cally, P450BM3 with a single T268A mutation exhibited
excellent trans selectivity for the cyclopropanation of styrene.
In contrast, variant P450BM3-CIS (9-10A-TS F87 V T268A)46
showed promising cis selectivity, which is rarely observed in
small-molecule-catalyzed cyclopropanation processes. It also
represented a departure from the innate diastereoselectivity of
Fe porphyrin-catalyzed cyclopropanation,47 highlighting the
role of the protein secondary coordination sphere in controlling
the reaction selectivity.

Mutation T268A was found to be generally activating for
cyclopropanation in a series of P450BM3 variants, likely by
enlarging the active site for carbene transfer. The T268 residue
in P450BM3 operates as the essential hydrogen bond donor in
the cleavage of the O−O bond in the native O2 activation and
oxygenation reaction.48 Previous investigation showed that
replacing this threonine with an alanine led to a substantial
decrease in the native oxygenase activity. The activating eﬀect of
T268A in cyclopropanation thus implies fundamental mecha-
nistic dichotomy between the native oxene transfer and the non-
native carbene transfer chemistry.49
■ AXIAL SERINE-LIGATED “P411” FOR CARBENE

TRANSFER

For cyclopropanation, the P450 has to be reduced to its ferrous
state to initiate the catalytic cycle. In our early work, P450s were
used either as puriﬁed protein or in cell-free extract in the
presence of exogenous reducing agents such as sodium

dithionite (Na2S2O4). We reasoned that we would be able to
develop an in vivo cyclopropanation if the heme enzyme could
be readily reduced by endogenous reducing agents such as
NAD(P)H. Such whole-cell biocatalysts would greatly simplify
the protein engineering process and enable new routes to the
sustainable production of valuable compounds.

We replaced the cysteine thiolate ligand in P450BM3 with a
weakly donating serine (Scheme 4). The CO-binding assay of

this engineered P450 variant revealed a ferrous CO Soret peak at
411 nm instead of 450 nm in the UV−vis spectrum,50 which is
why we refer to the axial-serine-ligated P450 variants as “P411”
enzymes. Replacement of this critical Cys residue was known to
abolish its monooxygenation activity;
in fact, the cysteine
thiolate ligand is the only amino acid residue that is conserved in
all known functional P450s. Electrochemical measurements
indicated that the redox potential E°′(Fe(III)/Fe(II)) of P411
shifted to −293 mV, which is well within the range of reduction
by NADPH (E°′ = −320 mV). P411BM3-CIS demonstrated
dramatically enhanced in vivo activity for cyclopropanation. By
further increasing the substrate concentration, total turnover
numbers of up to 67 800 were achieved in whole Escherichia coli
cells (Scheme 4). This represented the ﬁrst highly active
biocatalyst for carbene transfer. The advent of P411s turned out
to be a key advance for biocatalytic carbene and nitrene transfer
reactions. In subsequent studies, we found that serine-ligated
P411s were uniquely active for a range of new-to-nature
reactions where P450s displayed no or negligible activity.

■ FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF BIOCATALYTIC

CYCLOPROPANATION

Expansion of biocatalytic cyclopropanation followed two
directions: (1) We further engineered P450BM3 variants to
broaden the substrate scope of cyclopropanation, and (2) we
explored other heme proteins for biocatalytic cyclopropanation.
In subsequent P450BM3 engineering, we continued to explore
the role of the Fe-binding axial ligand. Heme proteins naturally
use a range of axial ligands, including cysteine, histidine, and
tyrosine. The identity of the axial ligand profoundly inﬂuences
the catalytic activity of heme enzymes.51 We found that the
C400H variant exhibited the highest activity for in vivo
cyclopropanation, while the C400Y and C400S variants shared
similar kinetic proﬁles (Scheme 5).52

Starting from P450BM3 T268A C400H, iterations of site-
saturation mutagenesis (SSM) and screening furnished
P450BM3 Hstar (Schemes 6),52 a highly active catalyst for the
cyclopropanation of a wide range of α-substituted acrylamides

surmised that stereoselectivities not
catalyzed processes could be achieved by exploring other classes
of heme proteins with altered active-site environments. Prior to
this study, elegant work from the Fasan laboratory demonstrated
the utility of engineered myoglobins in carbene transfer.57 We
focused on thermophilic heme proteins due to their superior
stability and evolvability.56 We found that wild-type Aeropyrum
pernix protoglobin (ApePgb) and Rhodothermus marinus nitric
oxide dioxygenase (RmaNOD) furnished measurable activity
for the cyclopropanation of 1-octene (Scheme 9). Notably,

undesired modiﬁcation of nucleophilic amino acid residues
took place following reaction with the incipient electrophilic Fe

mutagenesis of residues prone to modiﬁcation, which aﬀorded a
further improved biocatalyst, P450BM3 Hstar H92N H100N
(>20 000 total turnover number, TTN).54

Deeper mutational screening of the serine-ligated P411BM3-
CIS was also fruitful. Directed evolution of P411BM3-CIS led to
a set of complementary catalysts, P411-VACcis and P411-

access all four stereoisomers of cyclopropanation products with
excellent diastereo- and enantiocontrol.

With a series of evolved biocatalysts, we applied these heme
proteins in the stereoselective preparation of key cyclopropane
intermediates of pharmaceuticals, including levomilnacipran52
and ticagrelor (Scheme 10).58 In particular, a truncated globin

biocatalysts. With the P-4 A87F and A87W mutants, additional
rounds of SSM and screening ultimately produced variants
P411−K10 and P411−C6. These ﬁnal variants allowed for the
enantiodivergent synthesis of cyclopropenes with excellent
enantiocontrol (Scheme 11). Recently, using P411 variants

further evolved from the C−H alkylation lineage,3 internal
alkynes could also be eﬀectively transformed, aﬀording 1,2-
disubstituted cyclopropenes in uniformly outstanding enantio-
selectivity (>99% ee, Scheme 12).71

from Bacillus subtilis59 was evolved to provide the desired
stereoisomer of the ticagrelor cyclopropyl ester precursor with
excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivity.52 Fasan’s group also
demonstrated the gram-scale syntheses of tasimelteon and a
TRPV1 inhibitor using their evolved myoglobin variants in
whole-cell transformations.60 Collectively, these results show-
cased the potential utility of non-natural biocatalysis in the
manufacturing of value-added pharmaceuticals.

■ BIOCATALYTIC CYCLOPROPENATION AND

BICYCLOBUTANATION

Cyclopropenes are highly strained carbocycles. With strain
release, cyclopropenes can be easily converted to a broad
spectrum of synthetically useful molecular architectures.
Asymmetric catalytic cyclopropenation of alkynes is one of the
most widely used methods for the preparation of these motifs in
an enantiopure form. However, in contrast to Rh-,31,61−66 Cu-,
Ir-,67 and Co-based68 catalysts, no Fe porphyrin complexes were
known to catalyze the cyclopropenation process.47

Curious whether engineered P411s could catalyze cyclo-
propenation, we tested a terminal aliphatic alkyne as the
substrate and found that a P411 variant (P-4) previously
engineered for nitrene transfer could furnish the desired
cyclopropene with modest activity (260 TTN, 91% ee).69
Using P-4 as the parent, SSM at position 87 was carried out, as
residue 87 resides above the heme cofactor, and it is known to
play an essential role in controlling the stereochemistry in native
oxygenation reactions.70 The P-4 A87F mutant showed
improved activity and enantioselectivity relative to its
predecessor (290 TTN, 94% ee). Surprisingly, a single A87W
mutation completely reversed the enantiomeric outcome of this
cyclopropenation process, aﬀording the opposite enantiomer in
excellent enantioselectivity (240 TTN, −94% ee). The complete
reversal of stereochemistry (+94% ee → −94% ee) upon the
introduction of a single mutation, rarely observed in protein
engineering, highlighted the outstanding evolvability of P411

When aromatic alkynes were subjected to these enzymatic
conditions, the carbene transfer did not stop at the cyclopropene
stage. Instead, sequential delivery of the carbenoid fragment to
the alkyne substrate aﬀorded the highly strained bicyclobutane
as the ﬁnal product (Scheme 13).69 This unusual double transfer
required the same enzyme to accommodate both the alkyne and
the cyclopropene substrate, indicating a distinct promiscuity of
evolved P411. Furthermore, the bicyclobutane product formed
with complete exo, endo selectivity. This diastereoselectivity
diﬀered from the endo, endo selectivity observed in the only
known intermolecular bicyclobutanation, catalyzed by an
osmium porphyrin.72 Thus, P411-catalyzed intermolecular
bicyclobutanation represents a general method to prepare
interesting bicyclobutanes using easily available starting
materials.

Similar to silicon, biosynthetic machineries to form carbon−
boron bonds were also not known. Furthermore, enantiopure
organoboron compounds are coveted synthetic intermediates in
organic synthesis, since well-established stereospeciﬁc trans-
formations of these species allow access to a wide range of
medicinally relevant scaﬀolds. Encouraged by our success in Si−
H insertion, we embarked on the development of biocatalysts for
enantioselective B−H insertion (Scheme 16).75 Using N-

catalyzing the construction of carbon−silicon bonds are not
known.73 Prior art in metal-carbene chemistry demonstrated
that the insertion of metal carbenoids into Si−H bonds could
lead to the construction of C−Si bonds. We recognized that, by
repurposing heme proteins to catalyze the carbenoid insertion
into Si−H bonds, we could develop a biocatalytic system to
forge Si−C bonds.
We were particularly interested in the Si−H insertion of α,α-
disubstituted diazo compounds because the use of such
carbenoid precursors would engender a stereogenic center at
the α-carbon (Scheme 14). Although P450s were ineﬀective in

Scheme 14. Directed Evolution of Rma cyt c for

heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-boranes as our borylation agents
due to their stability under aqueous conditions, we quickly
found that wild-type Rma cyt c readily promoted the desired B−
H insertion reaction in living E. coli cells,
furnishing the
corresponding enantioenriched organoborane product in 70%
ee and 120 TTN. Directed evolution by targeting residues near
the heme cofactor furnished Rma cyt c V75R M100D M103T
(BORR1), which provided the organoboron product in 2490
TTN and 95% ee.
A notable feature of this biocatalytic B−H insertion lies in its
compatibility with an exceptionally broad range of α,α-
disubstituted diazo compounds (Scheme 17).75,76 Using
iterative SSM and screening, the BOR variants could be evolved
quickly for the customized synthesis of diverse enantioenriched
organoboron products that are versatile building blocks in
organic synthesis. Flexible loop engineering7 proved particularly
fruitful in the directed evolution of Rma cyt c for borylation
reactions. α-Triﬂuoromethyl-substituted organoboranes76 and
α-boryl lactones77 could be synthesized with good enantiose-
lectivity using BOR-CF3
Collectively, the successful development of non-natural Si−H
and B−H insertion reactions demonstrates a new strategy to
unveil and augment
the catalytic capability of proteins.
Furthermore, the integration of enzymatic Si−H and B−H
insertion into metabolic pathways in living cells could

inducing appreciable enantiodiﬀerentiation, we found that
Rhodothermus marinus cytochrome c (Rma cyt c) aﬀorded the
Si−H insertion product with excellent enantioselectivity (97%
ee, 44 TTN).2 Even though Rma cyt c’s native function is not
catalysis, its solvent-exposed heme center apparently accom-
modates carbenoids bearing two large α-substituents, thus
permitting their selective transformation. Further active-site
engineering ultimately gave a triple mutant Rma cyt c V75T
M100D M103E (“TDE”) that catalyzed the Si−H insertion with
1518 TTN and >99% ee. It tolerated a range of hydrosilane
substrates, giving rise to enantioenriched silanes with out-
standing enantiocontrol (Scheme 15). More recently, using
machine-learning-assisted directed evolution, we engineered an
orthogonal set of RmaNOD biocatalysts to access either the (S)-
or the (R)-enantiomeric product.74

tunities to synthetic biology.

■ BIOCATALYTIC C−H INSERTION
From a reactivity perspective, the insertion of a metal carbenoid
into C−H bonds is much more challenging than insertion into
Si−H and B−H bonds. Due to the ubiquity of C−H bonds in
organic molecules, site- and stereoselective C−H insertion
reactions hold the promise to signiﬁcantly simplify the syntheses
of organic compounds. Unlike other late transition metals such

Furthermore,
was recognized as a formidable challenge.

In our heme protein collections of P450s, P411s, cytochromes
c, and globins, we found only two variants, P-4 A82L and
RmaNOD Y32G, with measurable activity for the intermolecular
C−H insertion reaction (TTN = 13 and 7, respectively), which
underscored the challenges this transformation presents.3
Ultimately, however, directed evolution over 14 rounds of
mutagenesis and screening culminated in the highly active
variant P411CHF for C−H alkylation (Scheme 18). P411CHF
diﬀers from wild-type P450BM3 by 23 amino acids and lacks the
FAD domain of the reductase domain. This truncated P411
variant catalyzed the carbene insertion into a variety of C(sp3)−
H bonds,
including benzylic, allylic, propargylic, and heter-
oatom-stabilized ones, with excellent enantioselectivity
(Scheme 19). The use of acceptor carbenes for asymmetric
C−H insertion is relatively underdeveloped with rhodium
catalysts. Thus, these engineered P411s provided a new solution

to enantioselective C−H insertion using acceptor carbenes.
Furthermore, variants in the P411CHF lineage permitted the
stereodivergent C−H insertion with N-methyl tetrahydroquino-
line, thus allowing for the formal synthesis of both enantiomeric
forms of natural product cuspareine.
The biocatalytic enantioselective C−H insertion nicely
illustrates the power of directed evolution in solving challenging
problems in catalysis. Recently, we were able to engage α-
triﬂuoromethyl- and perﬂuoroalkyl-substituted diazo com-
pounds80 in C−H alkylation (Scheme 20).81 A set of
stereocomplementary P411 catalysts was engineered to access
either enantiomeric triﬂuoroethylation product.

Mutation L401P dramatically enhanced the catalytic activity
and the enantioselectivity of P411-PFA (1510 TTN, +88% ee →

of the residue next to the heme-binding cysteine disrupted the

Recently, Fasan,85 Koenigs,86 and our group87 all described
biocatalytic methods for the C(sp2)−H functionalization of
electron-rich heterocycles including indoles and pyrroles. We
found that a range of indole substrates could be alkylated at the
3-position using evolved P411-HF (Scheme 21). When Me-
EDA was used as the diazo source, P411 biocatalysts could be
evolved to furnish the alkylation product in an enantioselective
fashion. This is a rare example of an evolved P411 enzyme
showing promising stereocontrol for α,α-disubstituted diazo
compounds. Prior to this, engineered Rma cyt c was the only
protein class exhibiting good stereocontrol for these substrates.
Moreover, when pyrrole was used as the substrate, the site
selectivity could be easily tuned using the P411 catalyst, leading
to the C2 or C3 alkylation product with good regiocontrol.

■ BIOCATALYTIC C−H AMIDATION: INITIAL WORK
Enantiopure amines represent key pharmacophores in small-
molecule therapeutics.88 Consequently, general catalytic
methods for stereoselective assembly of amines have long
been sought after.89 In this context, catalytic nitrene transfer, i.e.,
the delivery of a nitrene fragment (R−N:) to organic substrates,
is a powerful technique for the synthesis of valuable amines from
readily available alkanes and alkenes. In a pioneering study
published in 1985, Dawson and Breslow demonstrated that
mammalian microsomal P450s could catalyze C−H amidation
with a turnover frequency (TOF) of ca. 2 min−1 using
iminoiodinanes as the nitrene precursor.90 Unfortunately, the

rapid solvolysis of iminoiodinanes91 made it challenging to
further optimize this system.

Almost 30 years later, concurrent to our investigations into
carbene transfer, we revisited this nitrene transfer chemistry and
engineered P450BM3 variants to enhance the activity for C−H
amidation (Scheme 22).37 We found sulfonyl azides to be

superior nitrene precursors for biocatalytic amination reactions,
in part due to the excellent water stability of organic azides.
Similar to what we observed in P450BM3-catalyzed cyclo-
propanation, the C−H amidation also starts with ferrous heme,
and the T268A and C400S mutations were found to be
beneﬁcial. Whole-cell biotransformations employing P411-CIS
T438S (variant “P”) provided the sultam products with
improved activity and enantioselectivity compared to the in
vitro reaction. Parallel to our investigation, in 2014, Fasan and

co-workers also accomplished intramolecular C−H amidation
using wild-type and engineered P450BM3.92

In a subsequent study, we demonstrated that either the six- or
the ﬁve-membered amidation product could be prepared with
excellent site selectivity in an enzyme-controlled fashion
(Scheme 23).93 Speciﬁcally, the I263F variant was found to
Scheme 23. Enzyme-Controlled, Regiodivergent C−H
Amidation (2014)

favor the homobenzylic amidation, whereas the P450BM3
T268A F87A variant was selective for benzylic amidation. This
regiodivergent amidation showcased the power of enzymes to
override the innate regiochemical preference through the
delicate control of substrate binding in the active site. It also
underscored the possibility of achieving site selectivities
previously inaccessible with existing small-molecule catalysts.
Furthermore, we expanded this biocatalytic enantioselective
C−H amidation to intermolecular processes.94 In contrast to
intramolecular nitrene transfer, only the serine-ligated P411
variants could promote the entropically demanding intermo-
lecular amidation. The P-4 A82L variant, a P411 previously
developed for sulﬁde imidation, was critical to this development,
showing low levels of promiscuous activity for benzylic C−H
amidation (Scheme 24). Introduction of
three active-site

mutations greatly improved catalytic eﬃciency. The ﬁnal
P411CHA variant eﬀectively transforms diverse benzylic sub-
strates into the corresponding sulfonamides with excellent
enantioselectivity (Scheme 25).

More recently, with a signiﬁcantly expanded library of P411
variants, we were eager to address unmet challenges in the area
of enantioselective C−H functionalization using P411 nitrene
transferases (Scheme 26). In principle,
three classes of
enantioselective C(sp3)−H functionalization reactions could
be developed. Starting from a substrate bearing two prochiral
secondary C(sp3)−H bonds, asymmetric C−H functionaliza-
tion would furnish products with a trisubstituted stereocenter.
Desymmetrization of geminal dimethyl-substituted substrates
via primary C(sp3)−H functionalization would generate a

quaternary stereocenter. Furthermore, enantioconvergent func-
tionalization of tertiary C(sp3)−H bonds would allow for the
formation of tetrasubstituted stereocenters. Such enantiocon-
tertiary C−H functionalizations have long eluded
vergent
synthetic chemists, presumably due to the lack of suitable
mechanisms for stereoconvergence as well as eﬀective catalysts
to induce asymmetry.95
Using the intramolecular C−H amidation of sulfamoyl azide
as a model system, we demonstrated that all three modes of
enantioinduction could be achieved using P411 catalysts.96

Among all the heme proteins tested, variants from the P411CHF
carbene transferase lineage provided the most promising results
for the amidation of secondary C(sp3)−H bonds. Active-site
engineering led to P411Diane2, a variant capable of transforming a
range of benzylic substrates into 1,2-diamines with excellent
enantioselectivity. In addition, unactivated secondary C(sp3)−
H bonds were also amidated eﬀectively. By using a set of P411s
that only diﬀered by four mutations, both enantiomers could be
accessed with good stereocontrol. Furthermore, P411Diane1

amidations via a putative stereoablative hydrogen atom transfer
(HAT)/stereoselective rebound mechanism. With evolved
P411Diane3 and P411Diane4, tetrasubstituted stereocenters pos-
sessing a nitrogen group could be eﬃciently accessed. Notably,
this biocatalytic platform could be engineered to construct
“methyl−ethyl” stereocenters with excellent enantioselectivity
(87% ee). Due to the minimal steric and electronic diﬀerence,
catalytic asymmetric formation of “methyl−ethyl” stereocenters
is a notoriously diﬃcult problem. Our study demonstrated that
engineered enzymes could overcome this long-standing obstacle
in asymmetric catalysis.

We also developed enantioconvergent

■ BIOCATALYTIC IMIDATION OF SULFIDES

P450-catalyzed enantioselective oxidation of sulﬁdes is a
powerful method for the preparation of optically active
sulfoxides. Early in our nitrene transfer study, we wondered
whether we could develop an analogous nitrene transfer to
sulﬁdes to generate enantiomerically enriched sulﬁmides, which
are key intermediates en route to many sulfoximide-containing
agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals (Scheme 27). It was found

Sulﬁdes (2014 and 2016)

sulﬁde as the model substrate.98 Using variant “P” as the
template, active-site engineering provided variants P-4 and P-4
A82I for the eﬀective conversion of both the (E)- and the (Z)-
substrates. Further investigation revealed that
this sulﬁde
imidation was highly enantioselective. Partial erosion of
stereochemical purity of the resulting allylic amine occurred
during the [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement presumably due to
the competing endo and exo transition states.

■ BIOCATALYTIC AZIRIDINATION OF OLEFINS

Optically pure aziridines are versatile building blocks to a variety
of nitrogen-containing compounds. We demonstrated that
P411s could catalyze the asymmetric aziridination of styrene
derivatives using tosyl azide as the nitrene source (Scheme
28).99 Through directed evolution,
the competitive azide

Scheme 28. P411-Catalyzed Asymmetric Aziridination
(2015)

reduction could be suppressed. The ﬁnal variant P I263F
A328V L437V allowed for the preparation of a range of
enantioenriched aziridines from electron-rich and electroneutral
styrenes. Due to their attenuated nucleophilicity, electron-
deﬁcient styrenes were less eﬀective substrates under these
conditions.

It was long believed that nitrene transfer to oleﬁns has no
counterpart in the biological world. However, in 2018, spurred
by the report of P411-catalyzed nitrene transfer, the Ohnishi
group found that, during the biosynthesis of benzastatin natural
products in Streptomyces sp. RI18, a cytochrome P450 (BezE) is
responsible for the intramolecular aziridination via a nitrene
transfer mechanism using N-acetoxyaniline as the nitrene
surrogate (Scheme 29).100 We were thrilled that mechanistic
insights gained through unnatural reactions in turn informed the
discovery of natural enzymes that operate through unconven-
tional pathways in biosynthesis.

Scheme 29. Bez-Catalyzed Nitrene Transfer in the
Biosynthesis of Benzastatins (2018)

that the P411-CIS T438S variant already showed good activity
toward the imidation of sulﬁdes without further engineering
(300 TTN, +48% ee).97 Enantiodivergent imidation could also
be achieved using an orthogonal set of P411 biocatalysts. Again,
this early example showed that, despite the homochirality of
biogenic protein catalysts, either antipode of the product could
still be conveniently accessed by engineering the protein.

The spontaneous [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of allylic
sulﬁmides leads to allylic amines. To reprogram this biocatalytic
imidation for the asymmetric preparation of amines, we re-
engineered our P411 nitrene transferases using phenyl allyl

■ BIOCATALYTIC C−H AMINATION USING

EQUIVALENTS OF UNPROTECTED NITRENE

In previously developed biocatalytic nitrene transfer reactions,
sulfonyl azides were the privileged nitrene source. Unfortu-
nately, the removal of the N-sulfonyl group requires harsh
reaction conditions, thus limiting the synthetic utility of nitrene
transfer products. To circumvent this problem, we initiated a
program to explore alternative nitrene precursors with no
protective groups attached to the nitrogen. We were particularly
intrigued by N-hydroxylamine esters (RC(O)O−NH2) as
aminating reagents, because the transformation of these reagents
would furnish unprotected primary amines.101−103 The
straightforward synthesis of unprotected, enantioenriched
primary amines remains a challenging problem. The successful
development of biocatalytic primary amination via a nitrene
transfer mechanism would allow for the conversion of
unfunctionalized alkanes and alkenes into enantioenriched
primary amines, thereby complementing transaminase-cata-
lyzed processes.
From an enzymologist’s perspective, the putative iron nitrene
species “FeNH” invoked in these amination reactions
the FeO
represents the closest structural mimic of
intermediate (compound I) in native P450 catalysis (Scheme
30). Thus, understanding the bonding and reactivity of this
presumed “FeNH” intermediate is of considerable interest to
the bioinorganic community.
Scheme 30. Comparison between FeO and FeNH

We ﬁrst targeted the amination of styrene derivatives (Scheme
31). Using wild-type Rma cytochrome c as the catalyst, we found
that the transfer of unprotected nitrene to styrenes aﬀorded
aminoalcohols as the ﬁnal product, presumably due to the rapid
ring opening of the unprotected aziridine under the reaction
conditions.104 Starting from Rma cyt c, active-site engineering

furnished the “TQL” variant, a highly active biocatalyst for the
asymmetric aminohydroxylation of diverse styrenes including
electron-deﬁcient ones. Further mechanistic study showed that
the hydrolysis of the unprotected, enantiopure aziridines is
enantiospeciﬁc. This ﬁnding suggested that enzymatically
formed enantioenriched aziridine is a possible precursor to the
1,2-aminoalcohol product.
We next explored C−H amination reactions using unpro-
tected nitrene equivalents. Using a P411 variant from the
P411CHA lineage94 as the parent, we engineered P411BPA for the
primary amination of benzylic C−H bonds with high activity
and excellent enantiocontrol. Most notably, no small-molecule
catalysts are known to promote the primary amination of
C(sp3)−H bonds despite extensive previous eﬀorts dedicated to
the study of Fe-catalyzed amination.101−103 The successful
development of this biocatalytic primary amination of C(sp3)−
H bonds illustrates the enormous potential of enzymes to enable
desirable reactivities elusive to small-molecule catalysts.
Even more exciting, P411 enzymes were found to catalyze
intermolecular allylic C−H amination with excellent enantiose-
lectivity (Scheme 32). Variant P411APA chemoselectively

Scheme 32. P411-Catalyzed Asymmetric Amination of
Benzylic and Allylic C(sp3)−H Bonds (2020)

aminates the allylic C−H bond,
leaving the oleﬁn moiety
completely untouched. This chemoselectivity is orthogonal to
the Rma cyt c TQL variant previously engineered for oleﬁn
aminohydroxylation.104 With P411BPA and P411APA, an array of
easily available hydrocarbon starting materials could be
converted into value-added primary amines. Further expanding
this intermolecular amination activity to unactivated C(sp3)−H
bonds would furnish an unprecedented, enzymatic method for
the amination of hydrocarbon feedstocks.

■ EVOLUTIONARY TRAJECTORY OF P450 CARBENE

TRANSFERASES AND NITRENE TRANSFERASES

P450BM3 has been the primary workhorse for the new-to-
nature reactions described in this Account. Starting from the
wild-type enzyme, we have evolved a family of P450BM3

variants to serve as highly active carbene and nitrene
transferases. It
is interesting to follow the evolutionary
trajectories of these diﬀerent enzymes, delineated in Figure 1.
These enzymes are all very closely related: the amino acid
substitutions in key P450 variants are summarized in Table 1.
As can be seen from Table 1, except for several early variants,
the majority of our evolved P411 carbene and nitrene
transferases share the same ancestor, P411-CIS. We often
found that a newly engineered carbene transferase acquired
promiscuous activity for previously elusive nitrene transfer
reactions. Similarly, newly evolved nitrene transferases opened
up exciting opportunities for challenging carbene transfer
reactions. Thus, there is a great deal of functional overlap in
these new enzymes, which provides starting points for evolution
and optimization of yet more novel functions.

Active-site evolution by site-saturation mutagenesis and
screening has proven fruitful for P450-catalyzed carbene and
nitrene transfer. Perhaps this is not surprising, since these
activities do not require the same ﬁnely tuned amino acid
environment evolved for P450BM3’s native function. Upon a

closer examination of the data in Table 1, it is evident that the
following residues are important for tuning the enzyme activity
and selectivity: (1) residues 70−87 in the B′ region; (2) residues
177−181 in the F helix; (3) residues 261−269 in the I helix; (4)
residues 327−330 in the K/K′ loop; (5) residues 436−438 in
the loop; and (6) the iron-binding residue 400. The ability to
quickly improve an abiological reaction of interest by iteratively
mutating a relatively small set of key residues makes this protein
engineering approach very attractive for catalyst development.
To help future engineering of P450BM3 biocatalysts for other
transformations, we label privileged active-site residues of
P450BM3 in Figure 2, whose mutation resulted in substantial
improvements in previously developed carbene and nitrene
transfer enzymes. Beneﬁcial mutations will of course also lie at
more distant residues, as is often found in directed evolution
campaigns. Thus, further optimization of a new catalytic activity
is possible if the screening capacity is suﬃcient to capture these
rarer events.

and nitrene transfer activities were achieved so easily. In
retrospect, several factors may have played important roles (in
addition to the inherent catalytic promiscuity of heme and heme
proteins, which enabled improvement using reliable directed
evolution approaches). First, the generation of Fe carbene and
Fe nitrene is highly exergonic. Unlike the generation of
compound I in native oxygenation reactions, the formation of
Fe carbene and Fe nitrene is likely kinetically facile and does not
require complex interactions with the protein scaﬀold. Second,
the nascent iron carbene and iron nitrene are highly active,
allowing for both bimolecular and unimolecular reactions to
occur rapidly at ambient
temperature. Based on these
considerations, we propose that reaction rate (kcat) is more
important than substrate binding (KM) for the initial develop-
ment of new-to-nature reactions.

Third, despite the highly active nature of iron carbene and
nitrene intermediates, their synthetic precursors including diazo
compounds and organic azides are relatively stable under
physiological conditions, even in living cells. This bio-
orthogonality limits the spontaneous decay of substrates and
ensures the productivity of enzymatic chemistry. Fourth, the
excellent evolvability of heme proteins dramatically accelerated
engineering campaigns. Last but not least, numerous ideas taken
straight from synthetic organic and organometallic chemistry
guided our design of new-to-nature biocatalytic processes.
Standing on the shoulders of giants, we saw great opportunities
at
the colliding ﬁelds of synthetic chemistry and protein
engineering.

We anticipate that the strategies underlying the work detailed
lead to the development of yet more
in this Account will
enzymes for challenging transformations. After all,
the
astonishing structural and functional diversity of naturally
available enzymes, and other proteins, will continue to provide
exciting opportunities for catalyst discovery. Using an
interdisciplinary approach combining genome mining, enzymol-
ogy, protein engineering, and synthetic organic chemistry, a
broader range of new-to-nature biocatalytic transformations is
yet to come.

■ CONCLUDING REMARKS

Over the past eight years, the ﬁeld of unnatural biocatalysis has
witnessed an explosion, and a variety of challenging stereo-
selective C−C and C−heteroatom bond forming trans-
formations have been realized through the directed evolution
from a synthetic chemist’s
of heme proteins. However,
perspective, biocatalytic carbene and nitrene transfer is far
from mature. Numerous processes of signiﬁcant synthetic utility
remain to be discovered or optimized. For example, by taking
advantage of the precise site- and stereocontrol imposed by the
enzyme, exciting new possibilities of selective C−H function-
alization await development.

Developing new biocatalytic reactions with no natural
counterparts was once considered very diﬃcult. Thus, one
might ask why these new-to-nature enzymatic carbene transfer
