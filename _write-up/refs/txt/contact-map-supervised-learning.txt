Abstract   

Protein  contacts  contain  important  information  for  protein  structure  and  functional  study,  but  contact 
prediction  from  sequence  remains  very  challenging.  Both  evolutionary  coupling  (EC)  analysis  and 
supervised machine learning methods are developed to predict contacts, making use of different types of 
information,  respectively.  This  paper  presents  a  group  graphical  lasso  (GGL)  method  for  contact 
prediction that integrates joint multi-family EC analysis and supervised learning. Different from existing 
single-family EC analysis that uses residue co-evolution information in only the target protein family, our 
joint EC analysis uses residue co-evolution in both the target family and its related families, which may 
have  divergent  sequences  but  similar  folds.  To  implement  joint  EC  analysis,  we  model  a  set  of  related 
protein families using Gaussian graphical models (GGM) and then co-estimate their precision matrices by 
maximum-likelihood,  subject  to  the  constraint  that  the  precision  matrices  shall  share  similar  residue 
co-evolution patterns. To further improve the accuracy of the estimated precision matrices, we employ a 
supervised  learning  method  to  predict  contact  probability  from  a  variety  of  evolutionary  and 
non-evolutionary  information  and  then  incorporate  the  predicted  probability  as  prior  into  our  GGL 
framework. Experiments show that our method can predict contacts much more accurately than existing 
methods, and that our method performs better on both conserved and family-specific contacts.   

Introduction 

Protein  contacts  contain  important  information  for  protein  folding  and  recent  works  indicate  that  one 
correct  long-range  contact for every  12  residues  in  the  protein allows accurate topology  level  modeling 
(Kim,  et  al.,  2013).  Thanks  to  high-throughput  sequencing  and  better  statistical  and  optimization 
techniques,  evolutionary  coupling  (EC)  analysis  for  contact  prediction  has  made  good  progress,  which 
makes de novo prediction of some large proteins possible (Hopf, et al., 2012; Marks, et al., 2011; Nugent 
and Jones, 2012; Sułkowska, et al., 2012). Nevertheless, contact prediction accuracy is still low  even if 
only the top L/10 (L is the sequence length) predicted contacts are evaluated.   
 
Existing contact prediction methods can be roughly divided into two categories: 1) evolutionary coupling 
(EC)  analysis  methods,  such  as  (Burger  and  van  Nimwegen,  2010;  Di  Lena,  et  al., 2011;  Marks,  et  al., 
2011), that make use of multiple sequence alignment; and 2) supervised machine learning methods, such 
as  SVMSEQ  (Wu  and  Zhang,  2008),  NNcon  (Tegge,  et  al.,  2009),  SVMcon  (Cheng  and  Baldi,  2007), 
CMAPpro  (Di  Lena,  et  al.,  2012),  that  predict  contacts  from  a  variety  of  information  including  mutual 
information, sequence profile and some predicted structure information. In addition, a couple of methods 
also  use  physical  constraints,  such  as  PhyCMAP  (Wang  and  Xu,  2013)  and  Astro-Fold  (Klepeis  and 
Floudas, 2003).   
 
Residue  EC  analysis  is  a  pure  sequence-based  method  that  predicts  contacts  by  detecting  co-evolved 
residues from the MSA (multiple sequence alignment) of a single protein family. This is based upon an 
observation  that  a  pair  of  co-evolved  residues  is  often  found  to  be  spatially  close  in  the  3D  structure. 
Mutual information (MI) is a local statistical method used to measure residue co-evolution strength, but it 
cannot tell apart direct and indirect residue interaction and thus, has low prediction accuracy. Along with 

many  more  sequences  are  available,  some  global  statistical  methods,  such  as  maximum  entropy  and 
probabilistic graphical models, are developed to infer  residue co-evolution from MSA (Balakrishnan, et 
al., 2011; Cocco, et al., 2013; Jones, et al., 2012; Lapedes, et al., 2012; Lapedes, et al., 1999; Marks, et 
al.,  2011;  Thomas,  et  al., 2008; Thomas,  et  al.,  2009;  Thomas,  et  al.,  2009;  Weigt,  et  al.,  2009). These 
global  statistical  methods  can  differentiate  direct  from  indirect  residue  couplings  and  thus,  are  more 
accurate than MI. See (de Juan, et al., 2013) for an excellent review of EC analysis. Representative tools 
of  EC  analysis  include  Evfold  (Marks,  et  al.,  2011),  PSICOV  (Jones,  et  al.,  2012),  GREMLIN 
(Balakrishnan, et al., 2011), and plmDCA (Ekeberg, et al., 2013). Meanwhile, GREMLIN and plmDCA 
do  not  assume  Gaussian  distribution  of  a  protein  family.  All  these  EC  methods  make  use  of  residue 
co-evolution information only in the target protein family, ignoring other related families.   
 
Supervised  machine  learning  methods  (Cheng  and  Baldi,  2007;  Shackelford  and  Karplus,  2007;  Wang 
and Xu, 2013) make use of not only mutual information (MI), but also sequence profile and other protein 
features, as opposed to EC analysis that makes use of only residue co-evolution. Experiments show that 
due to use of more information, supervised learning may outperform EC methods especially for proteins 
with few sequence homologs (Wang and Xu, 2013). Recently, a few groups such as DNcon (Eickholt and 
Cheng,  2012),  CMAPpro  (Di  Lena,  et  al.,  2012)  and  PConsC  (Skwark,  et  al.,  2013)  have  also  applied 
deep learning, an emerging supervised learning method, to contact prediction and showed some improved 
performance. 
 
In this paper, we present a new method CoinDCA (co-estimation of inverse matrices for direct-coupling 
analysis)  for  contact  prediction  that  integrates  joint  multi-family  EC  analysis  and  supervised  machine 
learning.  Since  joint  EC  analysis  and  supervised  learning  use  different  types  of  information,  their 
combination  shall  lead  to  better  prediction  accuracy.  The  contribution  of  this  paper  lies  in  two  aspects. 
First, different from existing EC analysis that makes use of residue co-evolution information only in the 
target  protein  family,  our  joint  EC  analysis  predicts  contacts  of  a  target  family  not  only  using  its  own 
residue  co-evolution  information,  but  also  those  in  its  related  families  which  may  share  similar  contact 
maps.  By  enforcing  contact  map  consistency  in  joint  EC  analysis,  we  can  greatly  improve  contact 
prediction. To fulfill this, we develop a statistical method called group graphical lasso (GGL) to estimate 
the  joint  probability  distribution  of  a  set  of  related  families  and  enforce  contact  map  consistency 
proportional  to  evolutionary  distance.  Second,  we  use  Random  Forests,  a  popular  supervised  learning 
method, to predict the probability of two residues forming a contact using a variety of evolutionary and 
non-evolutionary  information.  Then  we  integrate  the  predicted  probability  as  prior  into  our  GGL 
formulation to further improve the accuracy of joint EC analysis. 
 
Experiments  show  that  our  method  greatly  outperforms  existing  EC  or  supervised  machine  learning 
methods regardless of the number of sequence homologs available for a target protein under prediction, 
and that our method not only performs better on conserved contacts, but also on family-specific contacts. 
We  also  find  out  that  contact  prediction  may  be  worsened  by  merging  multiple  related  families  into  a 
single one followed by single-family EC analysis, or by consensus of single-family EC analysis results.   

Results and Discussion 

Test Data. It is selected from the 150 Pfam (Bateman, et al., 2004; Finn, et al., 2014) families used 
by PSICOV (Jones, et al., 2012) as benchmark, all of which have solved structures in PDB. To make 
a fair comparison, we use the same solved structures as PSICOV to calculate  native contacts. In this 
paper we consider only  𝐶𝛼  contacts and similar performance trend is observed for  𝐶𝛽  contacts. We 
denote these Pfam families, for which we would like to predict contacts, as the target families. For 
each target family, we find its related families in Pfam, also called auxiliary families, using HHpred 
(Söding,  2005)  with  E-value=10-6  as  cutoff.  As  a  result,  98  families  have  at  least  one  auxiliary 
family  and  are  used  as  our  test  data.  We  can  also  relax  the  E-value  cutoff  to  obtain  more 

distantly-related  auxiliary  families,  but  this  does  not  lead  to  significantly  improved  prediction 
accuracy. Among the 98 target families, the average TMscore  (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005) between 
the representative solved structures of a target family and of its auxiliary families is ~0.7. That is, on 
average  the  target  and  auxiliary  families  are  not  very  close,  although  they  may  have  similar  folds. 
Even using E-value≤10−17as cutoff, some target and auxiliary families are only similar at the SCOP 
fold level.   

Evaluation.  To  save  space,  we  tested  our  method  against  a  few  popular  EC  methods  such  as 
PSICOV, Evfold, plmDCA (Ekeberg, et al., 2013) and GREMLIN (Kamisetty, et al., 2013) and a few 
supervised  learning  methods  such  that  NNcon  and  CMAPpro,  all  of  which  were  run  with  default 
parameters.   

To ensure that the Pfam database does not miss important sequence homologs, we also generate an 
MSA  for  each  target  family  by  PSI-BLAST  (5  iterations  and  E-value=0.001)  and  then  apply 
PSICOV  to  this  MSA.  Such  a  method  is  denoted  as  PSICOV_b.  Since  HHblits  (Remmert,  et  al., 
2012)  sometimes  may  detect  sequence  homologs  of  higher  quality  than  PSI-BLAST,  we  also  run 
HHblits to build MSA for a target sequence and then examine if HHblits -generated MSA can lead to 
better prediction for plmDCA and GREMLIN or not.    

There  are  two  alternative  strategies  to  use  information  in  auxiliary  families.  One  is  that  we  can 
merge a target and its auxiliary families into a single one and then apply single-family EC analysis. 
To  test  if  this  strategy  works  or  not,  we  align  and  merge  a  target  and  its  auxiliary  families  into  a 
single  MSA  using  a  probabilistic  consistency  method  (Do,  et  al.,  2006;  Peng  and  Xu,  2011)  and 
MCoffee  (Wallace,  et  al.,  2006),  respectively.  We  denote  them  as  Merge_p  and  Merge_m, 
respectively. The other strategy is that we apply the single-family EC method PSICOV to each of the 
target and auxiliary families and then apply a majority voting method to predict the contacts in the 
target family. We denote this strategy as Voting. 

We  evaluate  the  top  L/10,  L/5  and  L/2  predicted  contacts  where  L  is  the  sequence  length  of  a  protein 
(family)  under  prediction.  When  more  predicted  contacts  are  evaluated,  the  difference  among  methods 
decreases  since  it  is  more  likely  to  pick  a  native  contact  by  chance.  Contacts  are  short-,  medium-  and 
long-range when the sequence distance between the two residues in a contact falls into three intervals [6, 
12],  (12,  24],  and  >24,  respectively.  Generally  speaking,  medium-  and  long-range  contacts  are  more 
important, but more challenging to predict. 

Overall performance on the PSICOV test set 

 

As shown in Table 1, tested on all the 98 Pfam families, our method CoinDCA significantly exceeds 
the  others  when  the  top  L/10,  L/5  and  L/2  predicted  contacts  are  evaluated,  no  matter  whether  the 
contacts  are  short-,  medium-  and  long-range.  When  neither  auxiliary  families  nor  supervised 
learning is used, CoinDCA is exactly the same as PSICOV. Therefore, the results in Table 1 indicate 
that  combining  joint  EC  analysis  and  supervised  learning  indeed  can  improve  contact  prediction 
accuracy over single-family EC analysis. We also observe the following performance trends. 
1)  In terms of contact prediction, the MSAs generated by PSIBLAST or HHblits are not better than 

the MSAs taken directly from the Pfam database.   

2)  A simple majority voting even underperforms  the single-family EC method. This may be due to 
a  couple  of  reasons.  When  a  single  family  is  considered,  PSICOV  may  make  wrong  prediction 
for  each  family  in  very  different  ways  due  to  the  huge  search  space,  so  consensus  of 
single-family results can only identify those highly-conserved contacts, but not those specific to 
one or few families. In addition, majority voting may suffer from alignment errors. 

3)  It  does  not  work  well  by  merging  the  target  and  auxiliary  families  into  a  single  MSA  and  then 
applying  single-family  EC  analysis.  There  are  two  possible  reasons.  One  is  that  the  resultant 
MSA may contain alignment errors, especially  when the auxiliary families are not very close to 
the target family. The other is that we cannot use a single multivariate Gaussian distribution to 

model  the  related  but  different  families  due  to  sequence  divergence  (at  some  positions).   In 
particular, Merge_p (i.e., merging by a probabilistic method) performs better than Merge_m (i.e., 
merging by MCoffee), so we will use Merge_p as the representative family merging method.  

PSICOV models the MSA of a protein family using a multivariate Gaussian distribution. This Gaussian 
assumption  holds  only  when  the  family  contains  a  large  number  of  sequence  homologs.  PlmDCA  and   
GREMLIN do not use the Gaussian assumption and are reported to outperform PSICOV on some Pfam 
families  (Kamisetty,  et  al.,  2013).  Our  method  CoinDCA  still  uses  the  Gaussian  assumption.  This  test 
result  indicates  that  when  EC  information  in  multiple  related  families  is  used,  even  with  Gaussian 
assumption, we can still outperform those single-family EC methods without Gaussian assumption.

Performance with respect to the number of sequence homologs 
Our method outperforms the others regardless of the size of a  protein family. Similar to  (Marks, et 
al., 2011; Wang and Xu, 2013), we calculate the number of non-redundant sequence homologs in a 
family  (or  multiple  sequence  alignment)  by  𝑀eff = ∑ 1
  where  𝑖  and  𝑗  are  sequence  indexes 
∑ 𝑆𝑖,𝑗
and  𝑠𝑖,𝑗  is  a  binary  variable  indicating  if  two  sequences  are  similar  or  not .  It is  equal  to  1  if  the 
normalized  hamming  distance  between two  sequences  is  less  than  0.3;  otherwise,  0.  We  divide  the 
98 test families into 5 groups by  𝑙𝑛 𝑀𝑒𝑓𝑓:[4,5), [5,6), [6,7), [7,8), [8,10)  and calculate the average 
L/10  prediction  accuracy  in  each  group.  Figure  1  shows  that  our  method  performs  significantly 
better  than  the  others  regardless  of  𝑙𝑛 𝑀𝑒𝑓𝑓.  In  particular,  the  advantage  of  our  method  over  the 
others is even larger when  𝑙𝑛 𝑀𝑒𝑓𝑓  is small.

Performance with respect to contact conservation level 
For  a  native  contact  in  the  target  family,  we  measure  its  conservation  level  by  the  number  of  its 
aligned  native  contacts  in  the  auxiliary  families.  The  98  test  families  have  conservation  levels 
ranging  from  0  to  8,  corresponding  to  non-conserved  and  highly-conserved,  respectively.  In 
particular,  a  native  contact  with  a  conservation  level  of  0  is  target  family-specific  since  it  has  no 
support from any auxiliary families. Correct prediction of family-specific contacts is important since 
they may be very useful to the refinement of a template-based protein model. 
Figure  S1  in  Appendix  shows  the  distribution  of  the  contact  conservation  level  in  our  test  set.  As 
shown  in  this  figure,  a  large  number  of  native  contacts  are  not  conserved.  Figure  2  (A)  and  (B) 
shows the ratio of medium- and long-range native contacts ranked among top L/10 predictions  with 
respect to contact conservation level. Our method CoinDCA  ranks more native  long-range  contacts 
among top L/10 than the single-family EC methods PSICOV, plmDCA and GREMLIN regardless of 
conservation  level.  CoinDCA  has  similar  performance  as  the  family  merging  method  Merge_p  for 
long-range  contacts  with  conservation  level  ≥5,  but  significantly  outperforms  Merge_p  for 
family-specific  contacts.  This  may  be  because  when  the  target  and  auxiliary  families  are  merged 
together, the signal for highly-conserved contacts is reinforced but that for  family-specific contacts 
is  diluted.  By  contrast,  our  joint  EC  analysis  method  can  reinforce  the  signal  for  highly-conserved 
contacts without losing family-specific information.

(B)  long-range.  The  Y-axis  is  the  ratio  of  native  contacts  ranked  among  top  L/10  predictions  by  a 
prediction method.   

 

Performance on the CASP10 test set 
We further evaluate our method on the CASP10 targets with two supervised learning methods NNcon and 
CMAPpro  and  four  EC  analysis  methods  PSICOV,  plmDCA,  GREMLIN  and  Evfold.  We  run  NNcon, 
PSICOV,  plmDCA,  GREMLIN  and  Evfold  locally  with  default  parameters,  and  CMAPpro  through  its 
web  server.  Again,  we  run  HHpred  to  search  the  Pfam  database  for  auxiliary  families  for  the  CASP10 
targets.  Meanwhile,  75  of  123  targets  have  at  least  one  auxiliary  family.  For  those  targets  without  any 
auxiliary  families,  our  method  actually  becomes  the  combination  of  single-family  EC  analysis  and 
supervised learning. As shown in Table 2, on the whole CASP10 set, our method CoinDCA significantly 
exceeds the others in terms of the accuracy of the top L/10, L/5 and L/2 predicted contacts.

We also divide the 123 CASP10 targets into five groups according to  ln Meff: (0,2), (2,4), (4,6), (6,8), 
(8,10), which contain 19, 17, 25, 36 and 26 targets, respectively. Meanwhile,  Meff  measures the number 
of non-redundant sequence homologs available for a target protein under prediction. We then 
calculate the average medium- and long-range contact prediction accuracy in each group. Figure 3 clearly 
shows that the prediction accuracy increases with respect to  ln Meff  and that our method outperforms the 
others regardless of  ln Meff. In particular, our method works much better than the single-family EC 
analysis methods when  ln Meff < 8.

Discussion 

This  paper  has  presented  a  GGL  method  to  predict  contacts  by  integrating  joint  EC  analysis  and 
supervised  machine  learning.  Evolutionary  coupling  (EC)  analysis  and  supervised  learning  are 
currently two major methods for contact prediction, but they use different types of information. Our 
joint EC analysis predicts contacts in a target family by analyzing  residue co-evolution information 
in  a  set  of  related  protein  families  which  may  share  similar  contact  maps.  In  order  to  effectively 
integrate  information  across  multiple  families,  we  use  GGL  to  estimate  the  joint  probability 
distribution  of  multiple  related  families  by  a  set  of  correlated  multivariate  Gaussian  distributions. 
Experiments  show  that  the  combination  of joint  EC  analysis  with  supervised  machine  learning  can 
significantly  improve  contact  prediction,  and  that  our  method  greatly  improves  contact  prediction 
over single-family EC analysis even for protein families with a large number of sequence homologs. 
We  have  also  shown  that  contact  prediction  cannot  be  improved  by  consensus  of  single-family  EC 
analysis results, and that a family merging methods can improve prediction for highly-conserved contacts 
at the cost of family-specific contacts. This paper shows that.   
 
Our  method  can  be  further  improved.  For  example,  similar  to  GREMLIN  (Kamisetty,  et  al.,  2013) 
and  plmDCA  (Ekeberg,  et  al.,  2013),  we  can  relax  the  Gaussian  assumption  to  improve  prediction 
accuracy.  This  paper  uses  an  entry-wise  𝐿2  norm  to  penalize  contact  map  inconsistency  among 
related  protein  families.  There  may  be  other  penalty  functions  that  can  more  accurately  quantify 
contact  map  similarity  between  two  families  as  a  function  of  sequence  similarity  and  thus,  further 
improve  contact  prediction.  There  may  be  other  better  methods  to  integrate  the  predicted  contact 
probability  (by  supervised  learning)  into  our  GGL  framework.  It  may  further  improve  contact 
prediction by  integrating  other supervised learning methods such as CMAPpro, NNcon and DNcon 

into our GGL framework.   
 
In  this  paper  we  use  Pfam  to  define  a  protein  family  because  it  is  manually -curated  and  very 
accurate.  There  are  also  other  criteria  to  define  a  protein  family.  For  example,  SCOP  defines  a 
protein  family  based  upon  structure  information  and  thus,  classifies  protein   domains  into  much 
fewer families than Pfam. In our experiment, the average structure similarity, measured by TMscore 
(Zhang and Skolnick, 2005), between a target (Pfam) family and its auxiliary (Pfam) families is only 
around 0.7. That is, many auxiliary families are not  highly similar to its target families  even by the 
SCOP definition. Indeed,  some auxiliary families are only similar to the target family at the SCOP 
fold  level.  That  is,  even  a  remotely-related  protein  family  may  provide  information  useful  for 
contact prediction.       
 
We  can  further  extend  our  method  to  predict  contacts  of  all  the  protein  families  simultaneously, 
instead  of  one-by-one,  by joint  EC  analysis  across the  whole  protein family  universe.  First  we can 
use  a  graph  to  model  the  whole  Pfam  database,  each  vertex  represent ing  one  Pfam  family  and  an 
edge indicating that two families may be related. Then we can use a graph of correlated multivariate 
Gaussian  distributions  to  model  the  whole  Pfam  graph,  each  distribution  for  one  vertex.  The 
distributions  of  two  vertices  in  an  edge  are  correlated  together  through  the  alignment  of  the ir 
respective  protein families.  By this way, the residue co-evolution information in  one family can be 
passed onto any family that is connected through a path. As such, we may predict the contacts of one 
family  by  making  use  of  information  in  all  the  path-connected  families.  By  enforcing  this  global 
consistency,  we  shall  be  able  to  further  improve  EC  analysis  for  contact  prediction.  However,  to 
simultaneously  estimate  the  parameters  of  all  the  Gaussian  distributions,  we  will  need  a  large 
amount of computational power.   

Methods 

Probabilistic model of a single protein family 
Modeling a single protein family using a probabilistic graphical model has been described in a few 
papers (Balakrishnan, et al., 2011; Jones, et al., 2012; Ma, et al., 2014; Marks, et al., 2011). Here we 
briefly introduce it since it is needed to understand our joint graphical model. Given a protein family 
𝑘  
𝑘  and the MSA (multiple sequence alignment)  of its sequences, let  𝑋  denote this MSA where  𝑋𝑖𝑟
is a 21-dimension binary vector indicating the amino acid type (or gap) at row r (of this MSA) and 
𝑘 (𝑎)  is equal to 1 if the amino acid at row r (of this MSA) and column  𝑖  is  𝑎. Let 
column  𝑖  and  𝑋𝑖𝑟

𝑘  denote  the  mean  vector  of  𝑋𝑖𝑟

length of this family and  𝑁𝑘  the number of sequences. Assuming this MSA has a Gaussian distribution 
𝑁(𝜇𝑘, 𝛴𝑘 )  where  𝜇𝑘  is  the  mean  vector  with  21𝐿  elements  and  𝛴𝑘  the  covariance  matrix  of  size 
21𝐿 × 21𝐿 .  The  covariance  matrix  consists  of  𝐿2   submatrices,  each  having  size  21 × 21   and 
𝑘   denote the submatrix for columns i and j. For any 
corresponding to two columns in the MSA. Let  𝛴𝑖𝑗
two amino acids (or gap)  𝑎  and  𝑏, their corresponding entry  𝛴𝑖𝑗

𝑘 (𝑎, 𝑏)  can be calculated as follows.

called precision matrix), which indicates the residue or column interaction (or co-evolution) pattern in this 
protein family. In particular, the zero pattern in  𝛺𝑘  represents the conditional independence of the MSA

The  previous  section  introduces  how  to  model  a 
single  protein  family  using  a  Gaussian  graphical 
model (GGM). In this section we present our probabilistic model for a set of  𝐾  related protein families 
using a set of correlated GGMs. Here we still assume that each protein family has a Gaussian distribution 
with  a  precision  matrix  𝛺𝑘   (𝑘 = 1, 2, … , 𝐾).  Let  𝛺  denote  the  set  {𝛺1, 𝛺2, … , 𝛺𝐾}  and  𝑋 = {𝑋1,
𝑋2, … , 𝑋𝐾}  denote the set of MSAs. If we assume that the  𝐾  families are independent of each other, we 
can estimate their precision matrices by maximizing their joint log-likelihood as follows.

To model the correlation of these families, we assume that the precision matrices are correlated. Now we 
will show how to model the correlation of the precision matrices through the alignment of these protein 
families.   

We build a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of these  𝐾  protein families using a sequence alignment 
method. Each column in this MSA may consist of columns from several families. If column pair (𝑗1, 𝑗3) in 
family  𝑘1  is aligned to column pair (𝑗2,  𝑗4), the interaction strength between two columns  𝑗1  and  𝑗3  in 
family  𝑘1  shall  be  similar  to  that  between  columns  𝑗2  and  𝑗4  in  family  𝑘2.  That  is,  if  there  is  one 
contact  between  two  columns  𝑗1  and  𝑗3,  then  it  is  very  likely  there  is  also  a  contact  between  two 
𝑘1  for  the  two  columns  𝑗1  and  𝑗3in  the 
columns  𝑗2  and  𝑗4.  Accordingly,  the  precision  submatrix  𝛺𝑗1,𝑗3
family  𝑘1  shall  be  related  to  the  submatrix  for  the  two  columns  𝑗2  and  𝑗4  in  the  family  𝑘2  (i.e., 
𝑘2   depends  on  the  conservation  level  of  these 
𝛺𝑗2,𝑗4
𝑘2   shall also 
two column pairs. That is, if these two column pairs are highly conserved,  𝛺𝑗1,𝑗3
be highly correlated. Otherwise, they may be only weakly related. Based upon this observation, we divide 
all the column pairs into groups so that any two aligned column pairs belong to the same group, as shown 
in  Figure  4.  Therefore,  if  a  target  family  has  𝐿  columns  aligned  to  at  least  one  auxiliary  family,  then

The  parameter  𝜆𝑔   is  used  to  enforce  residue  co-evolution  consistency  in  the  same  group.  It  is 
proportional  to  the  conservation  level  in  group  𝑔.  We  measure  the  conservation  level  using  both  the 
square  root  of  the  number  of  aligned  families  in  a  group  and  also  the  alignment  probabilities.  In 
particular,  𝜆𝑔  is defined as follows. 

                                                𝜆𝑔 = 𝛼√𝑁 − 1  √∏

Where  𝛼  is  a  constant  (=0.001),  𝑁  is  the  number  of  column  pairs  in  group  𝑔  and  𝑃𝑛  can  be 
interpreted as the average alignment probability between the target family and the auxiliary family  𝑛  at 
the  two  aligned  columns  belonging  to  group  𝑔.  Meanwhile,  𝑃𝑛  is  calculated  as  𝑃𝑛 = 𝑃𝑖𝑃𝑗  where  𝑃𝑖 
and  𝑃𝑗  are  the  marginal  alignment  probabilities  at  the  two  aligned  columns.  That  is,  when  the  two 
aligned column pairs are conserved, both  𝑃𝑖  and  𝑃𝑗  are large, so is  𝑃𝑛. Consequently,  𝜆𝑔  is large and 
thus the interaction strength consistency among the column pairs in group  𝑔  is strongly enforced. In the 
opposite, if the marginal alignment probability is relatively small,  𝜆𝑔  is small. In this case, we shall not 
strongly  enforce  the  interaction  strength  consistency  among  column  pairs  in  this  group.  By  using  the 
conservation level (or alignment quality) to control the correlation of interaction strength, our method is 
robust to bad alignments and thus, can also deal with protein families similar at different levels. 

Note that our formulation (3) differs from the PSICOV formulation only in the last term, which is used to 
enforce co-evolution pattern consistency among  multiple families. Without this term,  our formulation is 
exactly the same as PSICOV when the same  𝜆1is used. We use an ADMM (Hestenes, 1969) algorithm to 
solve formulation (3), which is described in Appendix.   

Including predicted probability by supervised learning as prior information 
Compared to single-family EC analysis, our joint EC analysis uses residue co-evolution information from 
auxiliary families to improve contact prediction. In addition to co-evolution information, sequence profile 
and some non-evolutionary information are also useful for contact prediction. To make use of them, we 
first use a supervised machine learning method Random Forests to predict the probability of two residues 
forming  a  contact  and  then  integrate  this  predicted  probability  as  prior  into  our  GGL  framework.  In 
particular, our Random Forests model predicts the probability of two residues forming a contact using the 
following information.   
1)  PSI-BLAST  sequence  profile.  To  predict  the  contact  probability  of  two  residues,  we  use  their 

position-specific mutation scores and those of the sequentially adjacent residues. 

2)  Mutual information (MI) and its power series. When residue A has strong interaction with B and B 
has strong interaction with residue C, it is likely that residue A also has interaction with C. We use the 
MI power series to account for this kind of chaining effect. In particular, we use MIk where k ranges 

from 2 to 11 where MI is the mutual information matrix. When there are many sequence homologs, 
the MI power series are very helpful to medium- and long-range contact prediction.   

3)  Non-evolutionary information such as residue contact potential described in (Tan, et al., 2006). 
4)  EPAD: a context-specific distance-dependent statistical potential (Zhao and Xu, 2012), derived from 
protein evolutionary information. The Cα and Cβ atomic interaction potential at all the distance bins is 
used. The atomic distance is discretized into bins by 1Å and all the distance>15Å is grouped into a 
single bin. 

5)  Homologous  pairwise  contact  score. This  score  quantify  the  probability  of  a  residue  pair  forming  a 

contact between two secondary structure types. See paper (Wang and Xu, 2013) for more details.   

6)  Amino acid physic-chemical properties.   
Some  features are  calculated  on  the residues  in  a  local  window  of  size  5  centered  at the  residues  under 
consideration. In total there are ~300 features for each residue pair.   
 
We trained and selected the model parameters of our Random Forests model by 5-fold cross validation. In 
total  we  used  about  850  training  proteins,  all  of  which  have  <25%  sequence  identity  with  our  test 
proteins. See paper (Wang and Xu, 2013) for the description of the training proteins. 
 
Finally, our GGL formulation with predicted contact probability as prior is as follows.

Alignment of multiple protein families 
To build the alignment of multiple protein families, we employ a probabilistic consistency method in (Do, 
et  al.,  2006;  Peng  and  Xu,  2011).  To  employ  this  consistency  method,  we  need  to  calculate  the 
probabilistic  alignment  matrix  between  any  two  protein  families.  Each  matrix  entry  is  the  marginal 
alignment probability (MAP) of two columns, each in one family. In addition to this probability method, 
we also employed MCoffee (Wallace, et al., 2006) to generate alignment of multiple families. 

Majority voting method for contact prediction 
Majority  voting  is  a  simple  way  of  utilizing  auxiliary  protein  families  for  contact  prediction.  We  first 
build  an  alignment  of  multiple  protein  families  using  the  methods  mentioned  above.  Then  we  use 
PSICOV to predict contact map for each of the related protein families. To determine if there is a contact 
between any two columns  𝑖  and  𝑗  in the target protein family, we use a majority voting based upon the 
predicted contacts for all the column pairs aligned to the pair  (𝑖, 𝑗). In addition, we also assign a weight 
to  each  family  proportional  to  the  number  of  non-redundant  sequence  homologs  in  it.  The  more  NR 
sequence  homologs,  the  more  weight  this  family  carries  since  usually  such  a  family  has  higher  contact 
prediction accuracy. In this experiment, each protein family is modeled using a different probability 
distribution since PSICOV is applied to each of the related families separately. 

Pre-processing and Post-processing 
We  employ  the  same  pre-  and  post-processing  procedures  as  PSICOV  to  ensure  our  comparison  with 
PSICOV  is  fair.  Briefly,  to  reduce  the  impact  of  redundant  sequences,  we  apply  the  same  sequence 
weighting  method  as  PSICOV.  In  particular,  duplicate  sequences  are  removed  and  columns  containing 
more  than  90%  of  gaps  are  also  deleted.  The  sequence  is  weighted  using  a  threshold  of  62%  sequence 
identity. We add a small constant (=0.1) to the diagonal of the empirical covariance matrix to ensure it is 
not singular. Similar to PSICOV and plmDCA (Ekeberg, et al., 2013), average-product correction (APC) 
(Dunn, et al., 2008) is applied to post-process predicted contacts.

Estimating precision matrices by Alternating Directions Method of Multipliers   

Since  the  same  algorithm  can  be  used  to  optimize  Eqs.  (3)  and  (4),  for  simplicity  we  explain  how  to 
optimize Eq (3) using Alternating Directions Method of Multipliers (ADMM). See (Hestenes, 1969) for a 
tutorial  of  ADMM.  To  estimate  the  precision  matrix  for  the  target  protein  family,  we  shall  solve  the 
following optimization problem.

To apply ADMM, we start from rewriting P1 as a constraint optimization problem  by making a copy of 
Ω  to  𝑍, but without changing the solution space. 

                  (P2)                  maxΩ,𝑍 𝑓(Ω) − 𝑃(𝑍)                                                              (6)

𝑘=1
Where  𝑍  denote the set  {𝑍1, 𝑍2, … , 𝑍𝐾}. Eq. (6) can be augmented by adding one term to penalize the 
difference between  𝛺𝑘  and  𝑍𝑘  as follows.

                                      ∀𝑘, 𝛺𝑘 = 𝑍𝑘      

P3 is equivalent to P2 and P1, but converges faster due to the penalty term. Here  𝜌  is a hyper-parameter 
controlling the convergence rate. Some heuristics methods were proposed for choosing  𝜌, such as (Boyd, 
et al., 2011; Wahlberg, et al., 2012). Empirically, setting  𝜌  to a constant (=0.1), our algorithm converges 
within  10  iterations  for  most  cases.  Using  a  Lagrange  multiplier  𝑈𝑘  for  each  constraint  𝛺𝑘 = 𝑍𝑘,  we 
obtain the following Lagrangian dual problem. 

  (P4)    min𝑈 maxΩ,𝑍 𝑓(Ω) − 𝑃(𝑍) − ∑ (𝜌(𝑈𝑘)𝑇(𝛺𝑘 − 𝑍𝑘) +

      (8) 

It  is  easy  to  prove  that  P3  is  upper  bounded  by  P4.  We  can  solve  P4  iteratively  using  a  subgradient 
method. At each iteration, we fix the value of  𝑈  and solve the following subproblem. 

          (P5)              maxΩ,𝑍 𝑓(Ω) − 𝑃(𝑍) −

                          (9) 

The  subgradient  of  𝑈  is  −𝜌(Ω −  𝑍),  so  we  may  update  𝑈  by  𝑈 + 𝜌(Ω −  𝑍)  and  repeat  solving  P5 
until convergence, i.e., the difference between  Ω  and  𝑍  is small.                               

To solve P5, we decompose it into the below two subproblems and then solve them alternatively.   

(SP1)        ∀𝑘,  (𝛺𝑘)∗ = 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥{𝑓(Ω) −

The sub-problem SP1 optimizes the objective function (9) with respect to  𝛺  while fixing  𝑍. Notice that 
in  SP1  no  two  𝛺𝐾   are  coupled  together,  so  we  can  split  it  into  𝐾   independent  optimization 
subproblems. The  sub-problem  SP2  optimizes  the  objective  function  with  respect to  𝑍  while  fixing  𝛺. 
Next we will show how to solve these two sub-problems efficiently. 

Solving SP1. SP1 is a concave and smooth function so we can solve it by setting its derivate to zero as 

follows. 

                                              (𝛺𝑘−1

− 𝛴̂𝑘) − 𝜌(𝛺𝑘 − 𝑍𝑘 + 𝑈𝑘) = 0            (12) 

Let  𝑀𝑘 = 𝛴̂𝑘 − 𝜌𝑍𝑘 + 𝜌𝑈𝑘 ,  by  Eq.  (12)  we  have  𝑀𝑘 = 𝛺𝑘−1
− 𝜌𝛺𝑘 .  That  is,  𝑀𝑘   has  the  same 
eigenvalues and eigenvectors as  𝛺𝑘−1
− 𝜌𝛺𝑘. Consequently,  𝛺𝑘  has the same eigenvectors as  𝑀𝑘. Let 
𝛿𝑖   and  𝑚𝑖   denote  the  𝑖𝑡ℎ   eigenvalues  of  matrix  𝛺𝑘   and  𝑀𝑘 ,  respectively.  Then  we  have  𝑚𝑖 =
𝛿𝑖

−1 − 𝜌𝛿𝑖, from which we can solve  𝛿𝑖  as follows. 
2+4𝜌

                                                                                𝛿𝑖 =

−𝑚𝑖+√𝑚𝑖
2𝜌

                                                  (13) 

Therefore  we  can  reconstruct  𝛺𝑘  from  𝛿𝑖  and  the  eigenvectors  of  𝑀𝑘.  The  main  computation  time  is 
consumed in calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of  𝑀𝑘. Since  𝑀𝑘  is symmetric and sparse, we 
can permute its rows and columns to obtain a diagonal block matrix, which can be done within running 
time linear in the number of non-zero elements in  𝑀𝑘. Then we divide  𝑀𝑘  it into small submatrices and 
calculate their eigenvalues and eigenvectors separately. 

Solving SP2. SP2 is a non-differentiable convex function and we can solve it by setting its sub-gradients 
to zero. That is, for each  𝑘, we have the following equation.                                                         

                                                  𝜌(𝑍𝑖,𝑗

Let  𝑆(𝑥, 𝑐) = 𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑥 − 𝑐 × 𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛(𝑥), 0). Eq. (14) can be written as follows. 

                                                                    (1 +

Squaring both sides of Eq. (15) and summing up over all  (𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘) ∈ 𝑔, we have the following equation. 

                                            ∑
