EVOLUTION

Selection enhances protein evolvability by increasing
mutational robustness and foldability
Jia Zheng, Ning Guo, Andreas Wagner*

INTRODUCTION: Natural selection plays a cen-
tral role in adaptive evolution, but we still know
little about its role in changing evolvability—
the ability to bring forth new and adaptive
phenotypes. Different kinds of selection may
increase evolvability by different means. Weak
purifying selection may enhance evolvability
by promoting the accumulation of neutral or
slightly deleterious mutations that can serve
as stepping stones toward new phenotypes.
By contrast, strong directional selection may
enhance evolvability by favoring the accumu-
lation of beneficial mutations that can enhance
both fitness and evolvability, such as mutations
that increase a protein’s thermodynamic stabil-
ity or its robustness to mutations.

RATIONALE: To find out how the strength of
selection affects protein evolvability, we sub-
jected populations of yellow fluorescent pro-
teins to multiple rounds of directed evolution

in Escherichia coli. To control the strength of se-
lection with precision, we used high-throughput
phenotypic screening via fluorescence-activated
cell sorting. During a first phase of our experi-
ment (phase I), we subjected our populations
to either strong selection, weak selection, or no
selection on the ancestral phenotype of yellow
fluorescence. During the second phase (phase
II), we evolved all populations under the same
selection pressure toward the new phenotype
of green fluorescence. We subsequently used
high-throughput phenotypic screening to
study how phenotypes evolved in all our
populations. In every generation, we also
studied genotypic evolution with single-molecule
real-time sequencing. We then engineered key
adaptive mutants and determined their phe-
notype and thermodynamic stability. In addi-
tion, we determined the robustness of their
phenotype to DNA mutations. Furthermore,
we quantified the foldability of these mutants

by unfolding them and observing their refold-
ing kinetics.

RESULTS: We found that populations under
strong selection for the ancestral yellow fluores-
cent phenotype during phase I subsequently
evolved the new green fluorescent phenotype
most rapidly during phase II. Compared to
populations under weak or no selection, they
reached higher green fluorescence during each
generation of phase II and evolved a green
emission peak more rapidly. Strong selection
promoted both the elimination of deleterious
mutations and the accumulation of foldability-
improving mutations. As a result, proteins under
strong selection evolved higher efficiency of
protein folding (foldability) and, to an even
greater extent, higher robustness to mutations
than proteins under weak or no selection. Their
robustness and foldability accelerated the selec-
tive sweeps of neofunctionalizing mutations
that are necessary to evolve a new phenotype.
By contrast, proteins under weak selection
accrued more deleterious mutations that slowed
down the fixation of neofunctionalizing muta-
tions during the evolution of the new phenotype,
even though neofunctionalizing mutations
had initially risen to higher frequencies under
weak selection.

CONCLUSION: Strong directional selection en-
hances the evolvability of a new phenotype to
a greater extent than weak purifying selection.
The responsible mutations enhance tolerance
to mutations, improve protein foldability, and
thus increase accessibility of a protein’s na-
tive state. In doing so, they promote the for-
mation of correctly folded states that can
display new functions after incorporating neo-
functionalizing mutations. Although “first
order” selection of fitness-enhancing muta-
tions can be in conflict with “second-order”
selection of evolvability-enhancing mutations,
our experiments demonstrate a class of mu-
tations that avoid this conflict, because the
mutations they reveal enhance both fitness
and evolvability. In the context of an adaptive
landscape (see figure), they do so by circum-
navigating rather than traversing adaptive
valleys, passing through flat regions of such
a landscape, and thus allowing an evolving
population to climb a new adaptive peak more
rapidly. More generally, our experiments prove
that natural selection itself can create the con-
ditions under which Darwinian evolution can

succeed. ▪

Selection can drive evolvability. Evolutionary theory holds that Darwinian evolution takes place on adaptive
landscapes of fitness, which can be visualized as topological maps of high-fitness peaks and low-fitness valleys.
This hypothetical landscape illustrates how mutations can increase evolvability by enhancing both fitness and
mutational robustness. Favored by strong selection because they enhance fitness, such mutations move an
evolving population into a region of low curvature and high robustness (red arrow), from which the population can
bypass rather than traverse (blue arrow) an adaptive valley on its way to an adaptive peak.

EVOLUTION

Selection enhances protein evolvability by increasing
mutational robustness and foldability
Jia Zheng1,2, Ning Guo3, Andreas Wagner1,2,4*

Natural selection can promote or hinder a population’s evolvability—the ability to evolve new and
adaptive phenotypes—but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. To examine how the
strength of selection affects evolvability, we subjected populations of yellow fluorescent protein to
directed evolution under different selection regimes and then evolved them toward the new phenotype of
green fluorescence. Populations under strong selection for the yellow phenotype evolved the green
phenotype most rapidly. They did so by accumulating mutations that increase both robustness to
mutations and foldability. Under weak selection, neofunctionalizing mutations rose to higher frequency
at first, but more frequent deleterious mutations undermined their eventual success. Our experiments
show how selection can enhance evolvability by enhancing robustness and create the conditions
necessary for evolutionary success.

N atural selection drives adaptation, but we

still know little about its role in chang-
ing the evolvability of a trait or organism
(1, 2). On the one hand, strong selection
for an ancestral phenotype may enhance
evolvability for derived phenotypes, because
it may favor mutations that enhance not just
fitness but also evolvability. The available
evidence is limited and indirect (3–5). For
example, a cytochrome P450 BM3 variant
engineered for greater stability and fitness
buffers the destabilizing effect of mutations
that are neofunctionalizing, i.e., that convey
new protein activities (5, 6).

On the other hand, strong selection may
impair evolvability because it purges weakly
deleterious mutations that can convey new
functions (7). Evolutionary theory holds that
selection helps populations find peaks in
adaptive landscapes of fitness, which can be
visualized as topological maps of peaks and
valleys. Weakly deleterious “stepping-stone”
mutations may help a population traverse the
valleys that separate different fitness peaks.
Such valleys, which are caused by epistatic
interactions between different mutations, are
abundant in the adaptive landscapes of evolv-
ing proteins (8–11). Weak selection that purges
only the most detrimental mutations can aid
such valley-crossing. Consistent with this view,
when the enzyme b-lactamase TEM-1 is sub-
ject to “intense neutral drift” during experi-
mental evolution—multiple rounds of mutation
and selection to preserve its native phenotype
of ampicillin resistance—the evolution of re-

sistance to the newly introduced antibiotic
cefotaxime is accelerated (3, 12). More gener-
ally, experimental evolution shows that a popu-
lation evolves a derived phenotype faster if it
harbors genetic variation in the loci that affect
the ancestral phenotype (3, 13, 14). Such stand-
ing genetic variation may even be adaptive if it
has little effect on the ancestral phenotype
(15). Therefore, conditionally neutral or weakly
deleterious mutations can accelerate the adapt-
ive evolution of a derived phenotype (15). Here
we performed experiments aimed to find out
whether strong or weak selection more ef-
fectively enhances evolvability.

Results
Strong selection leads to greater evolvability
than weak or no selection
We evolved yellow fluorescent protein [YFP, a
variant of a jellyfish fluorescent protein (16)]
in Escherichia coli from an ancestral pheno-
type (yellow fluorescence) to a derived pheno-
type (green fluorescence) (Fig. 1A). The protein
was engineered to be well expressed in E. coli
(16), but it is not native to E. coli, which mini-
mizes interference with the native E. coli pro-
teome. Studying evolvability in a single protein
can help us analyze the causes of evolvability
in molecular detail. In addition, the fluores-
cent phenotype permits us to control the
strength of selection with precision, because
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) can
screen individual cells for their phenotype.

We subjected each of four replicate popula-
tions of E. coli expressing yellow fluorescent
proteins to four rounds (“generations”) of
directed evolution. In phase I of our experiment
(Fig. 1A), we selected for yellow fluorescence
through either strong selection (populations
S, the top ~20% of fluorescing cells survive)
or weak selection (populations W, cells that

fluoresce above background survive) (17). We
also subjected four replicate populations of
yellow fluorescent proteins to four rounds of
directed evolution without any selection for
fluorescence (populations N, subject only
to neutral drift). After phase I evolution, we
initialized phase II evolution by subjecting the
same populations to another four rounds of
directed evolution under selection for green
fluorescence (Fig. 1A) (17). We used mutagenic
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to generate
0.84 amino acid–changing mutations per YFP
molecule per generation (tables S1 to S3).

During phase I evolution, yellow fluorescence
in the unselected populations N dropped rap-
idly and decreased to <5% of the ancestral YFP’s
intensity, indicating an accumulation of dele-
terious mutations (Fig. 1B). For populations
under weak selection, W, the intensity of yellow
fluorescence decreased after the first genera-
tion of evolution but remained constant in the
next three generations (Fig. 1B). This suggests a
mutation-selection balance between the pro-
duction of new deleterious mutations and selec-
tion against such mutations. By contrast, yellow
fluorescence in populations under strong selec-
tion, S, significantly increased by 92.5% after
four generations of evolution (one-sided t test,
P <0.001; Fig. 1B), indicating a likely spread of
beneficial mutations.

We genotyped ~500 to 1000 protein var-
iants per population and generation (table S4),
which revealed that our evolving populations
harbored different amounts of genetic varia-
tion. Specifically, during phase I, populations
W accumulated more amino acid–changing
mutations and greater genetic diversity than
populations S (figs. S1 and S2). Because greater
genetic diversity may facilitate adaptive evo-
lution, we hypothesized that populations W
may have greater potential than populations
S to evolve green fluorescence during phase
II evolution. However, the opposite was the
case. Populations S reached significantly higher
green fluorescence than populations W during
the first two generations of phase II evolution
(one-sided Dunnett test with single-step adjust-
ment, P < 0.05; Fig. 1C). In addition, popula-
tions S evolved a green (512 nm) emission peak
more rapidly than populations W (fig. S3).
Analogous differences exist between popula-
tions W and unselected populations N (Fig. 1C,
and figs. S1 to S3). In sum, selection on an
ancestral phenotype, and in particular strong
selection, facilitates the evolution of a derived
phenotype.

Strong selection on an ancestral phenotype
leads to the most rapid fixation of
neofunctionalizing mutations
To find out why strong selection causes greater
evolvability than weak selection, we studied the
dynamics of genetic polymorphisms in each
replicate population during phase II (fig. S4).

Fig. 1. Experimental evolution of yellow fluorescent protein. (A) We subjected four replicate E. coli
populations for each experimental treatment to directed evolution under selection for yellow fluorescence
(phase I, lex = 488 nm and lem = 530 ± 15 nm). After four mutation-selection cycles, we continued
directed evolution for four more cycles but under selection for green fluorescence (phase II, lex = 405 nm
and lem = 525 ± 25 nm) by selecting the top 0.01% of cells in each generation. The areas shaded in
yellow or green indicate the proportion of a population allowed to survive to the next generation.
(B and C) Fold-change of yellow (dashed lines) and green (solid lines) fluorescence intensity relative to
ancestral YFP in each generation of phase I (B) and II (C). Error bars represent 1 SEM, from four replicate
populations (single small symbols). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001 [one-sided Dunnett tests with
single-step adjustment to compare S with W (blue) or N (black)].

Two mutations (G66S and Y204C) swept
through each replicate S, W, and N popula-
tion. Because of their ubiquity, we refer to
these two mutations as universal mutations.
In addition, another 20 mutations attained a
frequency exceeding 30% in at least one re-
plicate of populations S, W, and N. To determine
whether all these (2 + 20) mutations are
adaptive for green fluorescence, we engineered
each of them into the ancestral YFP and
measured their effects on green fluorescence.
Only the two universal mutations G66S and
Y204C caused green shifts of the emission
peaks (Fig. 2A). Individually, these mutations
caused a ~9-fold and ~2-fold increase in green
fluorescence (fig. S5), and together they shifted
the emission peak from yellow (530 nm) to green
(512 nm; Fig. 2A). Thus, G66S and Y204C are
the only neofunctionalizing mutations.

To further characterize the role of the re-
maining mutations, we engineered each of
these mutations into the background of
G66S+Y204C, referred to as genotype U for
“universal,” and measured the effect of these
20 genotypes on green fluorescence. Nine
mutants significantly enhanced green fluores-
cence in the background of U (two-sided Dunnett
test with single-step adjustment, P < 0.001; fig.
S5), but none of these changed the emission
spectrum (Fig. 2B). These mutations might
increase the amount of soluble and functional
fluorescent protein, which may help explain
why green fluorescence also increased, albeit
very modestly, during selection for yellow
fluorescence in phase I (Fig. 1B).

Because only two mutations are responsible
for the green shift in phase II, we suspected
that the rapid spread of these two mutations

resulted in faster adaptation of the strong
selection (S) populations compared to the weak
selection (W) and unselected (N) populations.
Indeed, populations S displayed a higher fre-
quency of the universal mutations G66S and
Y204C, and of the universal genotype U, in at
least last three of the four phase II generations
(Fig. 2C).

Because the S, W, and N populations were
subject to identical selection pressures during
phase II, these faster sweeps likely originated
in differences between populations at the end
of phase I. We investigated if the reason was
that the neofunctionalizing mutations had
already attained a higher frequency in popula-
tions S at the end of phase I. However, this was
not the case. Both universal mutations had
lower frequency in populations S at the end
of phase I evolution, and one of them (Y204C)
had a significantly lower frequency in pop-
ulations S than in populations W and N (one-
sided Dunnett test with single-step adjustment,
P < 0.001; fig. S6).

Strong selection leads to greater
mutational robustness and higher foldability
than weak selection
To resolve this apparent paradox—faster spread-
ing of the neofunctionalizing mutations G66S
and Y204C despite their lower initial frequency—
it is relevant that our evolving sequences are
likely to acquire one or more new mutations
(with probability 0.53) in every generation
(table S2). In addition, mutations that are dif-
ferent from the two neofunctionalizing mutations
are expected to arise by chance alone 412-fold
more often than these two mutations (table
S2). This means that most variants containing
neofunctionalizing mutations will also accu-
mulate many other mutations, most of which
are near-neutral or deleterious (18, 19). Increased
robustness to such slightly deleterious muta-
tions would increase the fitness of genotypes
carrying neofunctionalizing mutations and
thus enable their spreading. We thus hypothe-
sized that populations S had acquired genetic
changes that cause greater robustness to dele-
terious mutations.

To validate this hypothesis, we mutagen-
ized populations S, W, and N at the end of
phase I and determined the residual fluo-
rescence and the frequency of fluorescence-
positive variants after mutagenesis. Populations
S had indeed acquired greater mutational
robustness, in both the ancestral yellow pheno-
type and the derived green phenotype. Specif-
ically, populations S retained significantly higher
yellow fluorescence intensity than popula-
tions W and N after mutagenesis (two-sided
Dunnett test with single-step adjustment, P <
0.05 and 0.01 for comparing S with W and
N; Fig. 3A). In addition, the postmutagenesis
frequency of yellow-fluorescence–positive
variants in S populations was 1.24-fold and

13.0-fold higher than in W and N populations
(Fig. 3B). Moreover, the postmutagenesis fre-
quency of high-green variants, which have
higher green fluorescence than the ances-
tral YFP, was 3.8-fold and 326.4-fold higher
in S populations than in W and N popula-
tions, respectively (Fig. 3B).

Because most deleterious mutations reduce
protein solubility by causing protein misfold-
ing and instability (20, 21), we suspected that
populations S have evolved the ability to buffer
such mutations by harboring protein variants
with especially high foldability (folding effi-
ciency) or stability (the free energy required
to unfold a protein). Folding efficiency and
stability can be jointly quantified by the con-
centrations of soluble protein in vivo (22). We
thus measured and compared the amount of
soluble fluorescent proteins in populations
S, W, and N at the end of phase I (17). The
amount of soluble proteins in populations
S relative to that of ancestral YFP is 1.9-fold
and 3.8-fold higher than that in populations
W and N (Fig. 3C). By contrast, the fraction of

insoluble protein in populations S is 2.8-fold
and 2.5-fold lower than that in populations W
and N (Fig. 3D and fig. S7), respectively.

We also analyzed the role of foldability more
directly by quantifying the refolding yield of
fluorescent proteins after unfolding (17). In-
deed, a higher percentage of unfolded fluores-
cent proteins in populations S refolded than in
populations W, N, and in ancestral YFP during
24 hours of refolding (Fig. 3E and fig. S8A).
Also, fewer than 50% of unfolded proteins re-
folded correctly at 25°C within 24 hours (Fig.
3E), demonstrating that solubility is likely
limited by correct protein folding. In addition,
the foldability of populations S did not de-
crease after random mutagenesis, whereas it
decreased in populations W and N (fig. S8B).
This observation suggests that increased fold-
ability also increases mutational robustness.

Foldability cannot be completely disentangled
from protein stability, because many mutations
affect both (20, 23). Stability can be estimated by
monitoring a protein’s structural integrity over
time, and we measured for all our populations

the residual yellow fluorescence after 12 hours
of incubation at 37°C, the temperature at which
we had conducted our experiments. All pop-
ulations retained more than 95% of yellow
fluorescence (fig. S8, C and D). Populations S
showed higher stability than populations
W, N, and ancestral YFP only at higher,
unphysiological temperatures above 65°C
(fig. S8, E and F). In sum, our experiments sug-
gest that the higher robustness of populations
S is primarily caused by higher foldability.

Foldability-improving mutations result
in greater mutational robustness and
higher evolvability
We next aimed to identify the genetic changes
that increased foldability and mutational
robustness by examining our sequence data.
We focused on the 2 neofunctionalizing and
20 non-neofunctionalizing mutations that
reached a frequency exceeding 30% at the
end of phase II in populations S, W, and N
(fig. S4). The best candidates among them are
four variants known to improve foldability
(F47L, F65L, V164A, and I172V) (23–25). All
of these mutations and a fifth one (K102E)
reached a higher frequency at the end of phase
I in S populations relative to both W and N
populations (fig. S9).

When we unfolded these mutants and re-
folded them (17), all five mutants yielded more
correctly refolded protein than ancestral YFP
(Fig. 4A), and three of them also refolded more
rapidly than ancestral YFP (table S5). In ad-
dition, the mutations cause increased protein
solubility (figs. S10A and S11). Notably, four of
them also increased foldability (figs. S10B and
table S5), and two of them significantly in-
creased solubility in the background U (one-
sided Dunnett test with single-step adjustment,
P < 0.05; figs. S10 C and S11), which folds with
similarly low yield (~30%) as ancestral YFP (fig.
S10D and table S5). The mutants also increased
thermostability, albeit only at unphysiologically
high temperatures (fig. S10, E to G, and table
S6), indicating that they probably do not in-
crease solubility by improving thermostability.
In sum, all five key mutations improve fold-
ability or protein solubility in the ancestral YFP
background, and four of them do so in the
green fluorescent protein background U.

To estimate the mutational robustness of
specific mutants, we used PCR to introduce
random mutations into ancestral YFP and into
each of the 22 high-frequency YFP variants. We
then calculated the percentage of fluorescence
retained relative to fluorescence before muta-
genesis. After random mutagenesis, four out of
five foldability-improving mutants retained greater
yellow fluorescence (by 13.3 to 25.2%) than
ancestral YFP (Fig. 4B), which indicates that
they increased robustness. In one of the mutants
(K102E), the increase in robustness was margin-
ally significant (two-sided Dunnett test with

single-step adjustment, P = 0.064; Fig. 4B).
After random mutagenesis, none of the other
17 mutations significantly retained greater yel-
low fluorescence intensity than ancestral YFP
(two-sided Dunnett test with single-step ad-
justment, P > 0.05; fig. S12). In addition, ran-
dom mutations in all foldability-improving
mutants created significantly more variants
that remained yellow fluorescence–positive
than ancestral YFP (two-sided Dunnett test
with single-step adjustment, P < 0.05; Fig. 4C).
Thus, foldability-improving mutations enhance
the mutational robustness of the original yellow-
fluorescence phenotype.

In addition, the five foldability-improving
mutants also enhanced the robustness of the
derived green fluorescence phenotype. First,
after mutagenesis, they retained significantly
higher green fluorescence intensity (15.2 to
35.3% higher) than randomly mutated ances-
tral YFP (two-sided Dunnett test with single-
step adjustment, P < 0.05; Fig. 4B). Second,
random mutations in the foldability-improving
mutants created significantly more variants
that remained green fluorescence–positive
(14.6 to 37.5% more) than ancestral YFP (two-
sided Dunnett test with single-step adjustment,
P < 0.01; Fig. 4C). In addition, three foldability-

improving mutations (F47L, F65L, and I172V)
significantly improved green fluorescence (by
more than 27.0%) when combined with the
two neofunctionalizing mutations (two-sided
Dunnett test with single-step adjustment, P <
0.001; fig. S5). These results suggest that the
foldability-enhancing mutations can accelerate
a selective sweep of neofunctionalizing mutants
during phase II. In support of this observation,
the foldability-improving mutations achieved
higher frequency in S populations than in W
and N populations during each generation of
evolution (fig. S13). Moreover, populations S
retained a greater percentage of cells with
higher green fluorescence than the ancestor
during phase II evolution (Fig. 5A).

The advantage of the foldability-enhancing
mutations could be mainly caused by their ef-
fect on robustness or by their effect on increas-
ing fluorescence. We distinguished these two
possibilities by measuring the effect of each
mutation on fluorescence with or without muta-
genesis. For example, the mutant F47L alone
caused a 1.067-fold increase in green fluores-
cence–positive cells relative to ancestral YFP.
After random mutagenesis of the mutant F47L,
the increase in green fluorescence–positive cells
relative to the mutagenized ancestral YFP was

1.390-fold. Thus, mutational robustness was re-
sponsible for most [84.2% = 100 × (1.390 −
1.067)/(1.390 −1.0)] of the mutant’s benefit for
green fluorescence phenotype. This holds also
for the other mutations, where we estimate that
on average, >75% of the fluorescence benefit
comes from increased robustness (Fig. 5B).
Thus, foldability-improving mutations likely
promoted the spreading of neofunctionalizing
mutations by enhancing robustness. This is con-
sistent with the observation that the foldability-
improving mutations did not greatly increase
specific green and yellow fluorescence on their
own (table S7). In the genetic background U,
three of these mutations (F47L, F65L, and I172V)
also increased specific green fluorescence by
more than 14% (table S7), and two of them
(F47L and F65L) may have done so because of
their spatial proximity to the chromophore (fig.
S14). Such improvements in specific green flu-
orescence might additionally help promote
the fixation of U.

Selection can eliminate deleterious
mutations despite the presence of
robustness-enhancing mutations
Although robustness-enhancing mutations aug-
ment the advantage of other beneficial mutations,

their interactions with deleterious mutations
are more complex. If they completely mask
the effects of a deleterious mutation, this mu-
tation may be preserved. However, if the mu-
tation remains somewhat deleterious even
in the presence of robustness-enhancing mu-
tations, it may still be eliminated by selection,
and at a rate that depends on the strength of
selection. To test whether selection in S pop-
ulations was sufficiently strong to eliminate

deleterious mutations, we first used nonsense
mutations, which produce truncated protein
isoforms (26). Indeed, the frequency of non-
sense mutations remained 2.1-fold lower in
S than in W populations and 18.7-fold lower
than in N populations at the end of phase I
(Fig. 5C).

To complement this analysis, we also used
the FoldX algorithm to predict destabilizing
mutations (17). Such destabilizing mutations

too became depleted in S populations (figs. S15
to S17). Specifically, highly destabilizing muta-
tions had a consistently lower frequency in
S populations than in W and N populations
throughout phase I evolution (figs. S15A to
S17). At the end of phase I, this frequency was
2.4-fold and 9.7-fold lower in S populations
than in W and N populations, respectively
(figs. S15A). Also, the protein variants of popu-
lations S were on average more stable than

Fig. 6. Mutational robustness helps increase genetic diversity and evolv-
ability. (A) Increase in the average number of amino acid–changing mutations per
fluorescent protein molecule relative to the beginning of phase II for evolving
populations S, W, and N. (B) Increase in genetic diversity relative to the beginning of
phase II for evolving populations S, W, and N. The data show the increase in the
number of amino acid–changing mutations (A) or in genetic diversity (B) in
populations S, W, and N at the end of phase II, relative to the end of phase I. Error
bars represent 1 SEM from four replicate populations. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P <

populations bypass fitness valleys in an adaptive landscape. Robustness-enhancing
mutations (short red arrow) can help move a population to a region of an
adaptive landscape with low curvature, from where an adaptive peak can be reached
more easily (long red arrow) than without robustness-enhancing mutations (blue
arrow). Strong selection can help increase the frequency of robustness-enhancing
mutations, and more so if such mutations also enhance fitness.

those of populations W and N during phase I
evolution (fig. S15B).

Because computational stability predictions
may be inaccurate when a protein harbors
multiple amino acid changes (27), we also
experimentally measured the stability of fluo-
rescent proteins expressed in our populations.
In these experiments, proteins from S pop-
ulations showed greater stability at 65° to 80°
C than those from W and N populations (fig.
S8E). This prevalence of more stable proteins
in S populations also persisted after muta-
genesis (fig. S8F). In sum, selection can purge
strongly deleterious mutations even in the
presence of robustness-enhancing mutations.

Robustness-enhancing mutations help
increase genetic diversity in populations
subject to selection
Though not completely preventing the purging
of deleterious mutations, robustness-enhancing
mutations can still increase genetic diversity
within a population by helping a population
tolerate some deleterious mutations. Spe-
cifically, we observed that in both S and W
(but not N) populations, proteins that carried
robustness-enhancing mutations also harbored
a significantly greater number of other amino
acid changes at the end of phase I (one-sided
t tests, P < 0.05; fig. S18).

To further examine whether robustness-
enhancing mutations help populations S tole-
rate deleterious mutations during phase II
evolution, we focused on the 22 mutations
that reached a frequency exceeding 30% at
the evolutionary end point. Among these muta-

tions, we identified four strongly deleterious
mutations that significantly reduced the fluo-
rescence of the universal green fluorescent
genotype U by more than 20% (E18G, M79L,
R110S, and N145S; two-sided Dunnett test
with single-step adjustment, P < 0.001; fig. S5).
Three of these deleterious mutations occurred
in populations S, whereas only one of them oc-
curred in any other population. Notably, more
than 85% of the genetic variants that harbored
one of these mutations also harbored at least
one of the five foldability-improving mutations
at the evolutionary end point (fig. S19). This
suggests that robustness-enhancing mutations
helped populations S tolerate strongly delete-
rious mutations. It is also consistent with the
observation that populations S experienced
greater increases in both the number of ami-
no acid changes and genetic diversity than
populations W and N during phase II evolution
(Fig. 6, A and B).

Discussion
Neutral or weakly deleterious mutations can
play an important role in adaptive evolution
(13, 28), because they can convey new functions.
They also help populations respond rapidly to
environmental changes (3, 7, 12, 13) and traverse
fitness valleys created by epistatic (nonadditive)
mutational interactions (29). Weak purifying
selection facilitates the accumulation of such
mutations (7). If they were central to the evolu-
tion of a derived green fluorescence phenotype,
our weak selection regime should have resulted
in higher evolvability of this phenotype. How-
ever, we found that strong selection led to

more rapid evolution of the green fluorescence
phenotype (Fig. 1B).

To understand why, consider that many
proteins are marginally foldable (30) and mar-
ginally stable (31). Also, most mutations ac-
cumulated during evolution will further reduce
protein foldability and stability (20, 32), es-
pecially under weak selection (12, 33, 34). To
function well, most proteins must first fold
correctly (high foldability) and maintain struc-
tural integrity after folding (high stability)
(35), resulting in selection on the evolution of
foldability and stability. As a result, strong selec-
tion not only can stop the erosion of foldability
and stability by purging deleterious mutations, it
also favors mutations that enhance both proper-
ties. This ability is especially important during
the evolution of new phenotypes, because neo-
functionalizing mutations usually destabilize
proteins and reduce folding efficiency (5, 34, 36).
In our experiments, strong selection favored
mutations that increase foldability and, to an
even greater extent, mutational robustness. In
doing so, selection enhanced the penetrance
of beneficial mutations (Fig. 5A) and accel-
erated selective sweeps (Fig. 2C). In addition,
foldability-improving mutations may also pro-
mote the fixation of neofunctionalizing muta-
tions by improving their specific protein
activity during adaptive evolution (table S7).
We anticipate that our observations apply to
the evolution of most proteins in which fold-
ability and stability are important.

Our experiments required high mutation
rates so that we could observe adaptive evolu-
tion on a laboratory time scale. Comparable

mutation rates have been observed in viruses
(37, 38) and microbes, especially those that are
challenged to evolve rapidly by environmental
stressors (39–42). Such high mutation rates
are also required for the evolution of robust-
ness as a direct response to mutation pressure
(3, 4, 43). However, because our evolvability-
enhancing mutations increase both robust-
ness and foldability (Fig. 6C), their direct
fitness benefit (fig. S20) would help them
accumulate also under much lower mutation
rates. An important question is whether the
advantage of strong selection for evolvability
also persists at low mutation rates.

Our work highlights the important role of
standing variation for evolvability (13, 14, 20, 44–46).
It shows that natural selection can play a crucial
and active role in creating standing variation
that is both beneficial and enhances evolvability—
for example, by increasing robustness to dele-
terious mutations. This contrasts with some
theoretical and experimental work, in which
first-order selection for fitness conflicts with
second-order selection for robustness (47, 48).
We predict that evolution can avoid this con-
flict when mutations with both fitness-enhancing
and evolvability-enhancing roles exist.

Our work also suggests experimental de-
signs that select for beneficial mutations without
depleting genetic variation before selecting for
a new phenotype. Such experiments could be
further enhanced by starting with protein
variants engineered for high robustness. Fur-
thermore, our observations extend beyond
bioengineering. We expect that the evolution-
ary rescue of populations after environmental
challenges, like climate change, may be easier
in cases when a population’s evolutionary po-
tential has been previously enhanced by strong
selection. Most generally, our observations sug-
gest that natural selection can create favorable
conditions for Darwinian evolution.

Materials and methods summary
Plasmids and strains
We used the plasmid vector pBAD202/D-TOPO
(K4202-01, Invitrogen) for cloning and ex-
pressing YFP alleles. This vector contains a
kanamycin resistance marker and an arabinose-
inducible araBAD promoter. We used E. coli
strain BW27783 (CGSC 12119) as a host to enable
the homogeneous expression of the arabinose-
inducible araBAD promoter (49).

Creating mutant libraries
We used the same mutagenesis protocol during
phase I and phase II of our experiments (17).
Specifically, we performed mutagenic PCR
(using the primers MutafpF and MutafpR,
table S8) to randomly introduce mutations
into the coding region of YFP, inserted the re-
sulting mutant pool into the vector backbone
by ligation, and then electroporated the liga-
tion product into electrocompetent cells (17).

After electroporation, we immediately added
1 ml of prewarmed SOC medium, incubated the
recovering cell culture for 1.5 hours at 37°C with
shaking at 220 rpm in a 50-ml tube, and used
the recovered culture for further experiments.
To avoid the accumulation of mutations in
the plasmid outside the YFP coding region, we
inserted randomly mutated YFP genes into a
fresh plasmid backbone in each generation. In
addition, to avoid mutations that might ac-
cumulate in the E. coli genome, we transformed
mutated YFP gene pools into fresh E. coli com-
petent cells in each generation.

Directed evolution
We induced fluorescent protein expression in
evolving populations at 37°C for 12 hours (with
shaking at 220 rpm) by using 0.2% arabinose
(17). We used an Aria III cell sorter (BD
Biosciences) to sort cells at 4°C in the fluores-
cein isothiocyanate (FITC) channel (lex =
488 nm, lem = 530 ± 15 nm; phase I evolution)
or in the AmCyan channel (lex = 405 nm,
lem = 525 ± 25 nm; phase II evolution) accord-
ing to the selection criteria described in Fig. 1.
In phase I evolution, we collected ~106 selected
cells in ~1 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) buffer at 4°C for each replicate popula-
tion (17). In phase II evolution, we first selected
~5 × 104 cells with the top 1% of green
fluorescence intensity, regrew the sorted cells,
and repeated the sorting process by again select-
ing ~104 cells in the top 1% of green fluorescence
intensity (17). In each round, we regrew sorted
cells, and isolated plasmids from sorted cells and
used them as templates for the next mutation-
selection cycle and for single-molecule real-time
(SMRT) sequencing (17). To prevent cell prolif-
eration or death, we placed selected cells on ice
before the subsequent steps.

Engineering YFP variants
We used whole-plasmid PCR to engineer single
mutants and some double mutants by design-
ing primers that carry the corresponding muta-
tions (table S9) (17). We also used whole-plasmid
PCR to engineer single mutations into the
genetic backgrounds of G66S, Y204C, or U
(G66T + Y204C) by using the mutants G66S,
Y204C, or U as templates (17). We used Gibson
Assembly Master Mix (E2611, NEB) to engineer
the double-mutant U (G66T+Y204C) by using
the primers G66Sf/Y204Cr and Y204Cr/G66Sf
(table S9) (17).

Fluorescence assay using flow cytometry
We grew evolving populations or engineered
variants in 200 m l or 2 ml of LB with 0.2%
arabinose to induce the expression of YFP
variants in evolving populations or engineered
YFP variants (17). We added 40 m l of a culture
to 160 ml of cold PBS buffer, transferred 20 m l of
the resulting suspension to 180 m l of cold PBS
buffer, and mixed the solution thoroughly. We

used the resulting mixture to measure yel-
low fluorescence (lex = 488 nm and lem =
530 ± 15 nm) and green fluorescence (lex =
405 nm and lem = 525 ± 25 nm) using flow
cytometry. We performed fluorescence as-
says at room temperature with a flow rate of
~3000 events/s by using a Fortessa cell ana-
lyzer (BD Biosciences). We performed at least
three biological replicates for each replicate
population or each variant and analyzed ~104
events per replicate. To prevent cell prolifer-
ation or death, we placed all samples on ice
until we had finished all assays.

Flow cytometry data analysis
We performed flow cytometry data analysis by
using FlowJo V10.4.2 (LLC). Briefly, we used
forward scatter height (FSC-H) versus side
scatter height (SSC-H) density plots to select
a homogeneous cell population (p1 in fig. S21A),
and used side scatter area (SSC-A) versus SSC-H
density plots to exclude doublets (p2 in fig.
S21B). We used the resulting filtered data p2
for determining the fluorescence intensity of
evolving populations and for determining mu-
tational robustness of evolving populations
and those single mutants (Figs. 1, 3, 4, and
5 and fig. S12). We used FITC-height versus
AmCyan-height density plots to select the domi-
nant cell population (p3 in fig. S21C) and used
the resulting filtered data p3 for determining
the fluorescence intensity of each mutant (figs.
S5 and S20).

Protein solubility determination and refolding
kinetics measurements
We induced the expression of YFP variants in
evolving populations or engineered mutants
by growing cells in 2 ml of LB medium with
50 mg/ml of kanamycin and 0.2% arabinose
in a 10-ml tube at 37°C and at 220 rpm for
12 hours (17). We used CelLytic B Cell Lysis
Reagent (B7435-500ml, Sigma) to extract both
soluble and insoluble proteins from the col-
lected cells by following the manufacturer’s
protocol (17). We quantified the amount of
both soluble and insoluble proteins in each
sample by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electro-
phoresis (SDS-PAGE) (17).

To unfold proteins, we diluted 5 ml of crude
lysate with 45 ml of 9 M urea (containing
10 mM dithiothreitol) and incubated the solu-
tion at 95°C for 5 min. To refold unfolded pro-
teins, we diluted 10 ml of the unfolded samples
with 180 ml of TNG buffer in a 96-well microplate
and used an infinite F200 Pro (lex = 485 nm,
lem= 530 nm) or a Spark 10 M (lex = 485 nm,
lem = 530 nm and lex = 405 nm, lem = 512 nm)
microplate reader to measure fluorescence
intensity at ~20-min intervals (17).

SMRT sequencing and sequence data analysis
We barcoded YFP variants of each replicate
population by using PCR and ligation for SMRT

sequencing and used the Paciﬁc Biosciences
RS2 instrument (Paciﬁc Biosciences) to per-
form sequencing (17). We used the SMRTA-
nalysis v2.3 package (50) to perform primary
data analysis (17). We wrote Python scripts
(Python 2.7.12) to identify point mutations
and their combinations and to calculate genetic
diversity in each replicate population from each
generation of evolution (17).

Statistical analysis
Unless specified otherwise, we conducted pair-
wise comparisons by using a one-tailed t test
and conducted multiple comparisons to a con-
trol by using a one-sided Dunnett test with
single-step adjustment. We performed all
statistical analysis using R version 3.4.1.

Selection enhances protein evolvability by increasing mutational robustness and foldability

Selection enhances mutation toleration

Mutations generate variability that is either neutral or subject to natural selection. Robustness is a measure of the
 populations expressing a yellow
ability to withstand deleterious mutational effects. Zheng 
fluorescent protein to strong, weak, or no selection for yellow fluorescence for four generations. They then selected 
these
populations to a related function, green fluorescence, for four more generations. The strong selection first for yellow and 
then green fluorescence resulted in the most green fluorescence and the accumulation of the most mutations. This
outcome likely was due to the increased foldability of the protein. Selection thus provides a threshold for mutation 
accumulation, but robustness maintains a buffer necessary for protein evolution.
