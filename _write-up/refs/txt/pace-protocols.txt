evolution

Directed evolution, which applies the principles of Darwinian evolution to a laboratory setting, is a powerful strategy for
generating biomolecules with diverse and tailored properties. This technique can be implemented in a highly efﬁcient
manner using continuous evolution, which enables the steps of directed evolution to proceed seamlessly over many
successive generations with minimal researcher intervention. Phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) enables
continuous directed evolution in bacteria by mapping the steps of Darwinian evolution onto the bacteriophage life cycle
and allows directed evolution to occur on much faster timescales compared to conventional methods. This protocol
provides detailed instructions on evolving proteins using PACE and phage-assisted non-continuous evolution (PANCE)
and includes information on the preparation of selection phage and host cells, the assembly of a continuous ﬂow
apparatus and the performance and analysis of evolution experiments. This protocol can be performed in as little as
2 weeks to complete more than 100 rounds of evolution (complete cycles of mutation, selection and replication) in a single
PACE experiment.

A single round of conventional directed evolution of gene-encoded biomolecules requires four dis-
crete steps: mutagenesis, gene expression, screening or selection and replication1,2. Typically, per-
forming these four steps to complete a round of evolution requires several days and extensive
researcher engagement. Because it often takes several rounds or more to evolve desirable properties,
the ability to carry out laboratory evolution in an automated or self-sustaining manner can greatly
increase the efﬁciency of obtaining optimal protein variants. The ﬁrst demonstration of so-called
‘continuous’ evolution was reported by Mills et al. over 5 decades ago3. In this seminal work, the Qβ
phage RNA genome was minimized and optimized through serial ampliﬁcation with its cognate
RNA-dependent RNA replicase. Thirty years later, Wright and Joyce established the feasibility of the
continuous evolution of catalytic function4. This groundbreaking work was nevertheless limited to
in vitro RNA evolution and not easily adaptable to proteins or intracellular settings.

PACE was reported in 2011 as a versatile continuous method for protein evolution in bacterial
cells5. By mapping the discrete steps of laboratory evolution onto the life cycle of M13 ﬁlamentous
bacteriophage and using mutagenesis plasmids to diversify in situ, PACE requires minimal researcher
intervention during evolution and allows for the evolution of new or improved activity in signiﬁcantly
shorter timespans compared to traditional methods. Here we describe a protocol for PACE with
instructions for preparation of cell lines, phage and an apparatus for continuous ﬂow. We also include
instructions to adapt these components for PANCE and describe approaches for the analysis of
evolution experiments.

Development of the protocol
During PACE, propagation of an evolving population of ﬁlamentous bacteriophage (‘selection phage’
(SP); Box 1) is dependent on the activity of a protein of interest (POI; Box 1) encoded in the phage
genome (Fig. 1a)2,5. The SP exist in a ‘lagoon’ of ﬁxed volume that is continuously diluted with a
culture of host Escherichia coli cells. The SP population can persist in the lagoon only if their rate of
propagation from infecting and replicating in host cells exceeds their rate of dilution. The SP are
engineered to lack gene III (gIII), which encodes the minor coat protein pIII. Because pIII is

POI: protein of interest. The protein whose activity is selected for in evolution.
SP: selection phage. M13 bacteriophage with gIII removed from the genome. The POI is encoded on the SP genome in its place under the control of
the gIII promoter (PgIII).
AP: accessory plasmid. A plasmid in the host cells that encodes the phage survival genes, usually comprised of gIII transcribed from a promoter
that is triggered by POI activity.
CP: complementary plasmid. A plasmid in the host cells that expresses any non-evolving proteins or other elements that are important for
supporting the selection. Often, this plasmid encodes a polymerase that is activated by POI activity.
MP: mutagenesis plasmid. A plasmid in the host cells that expresses mutagenic genes upon induction with arabinose. The most commonly used
mutagenesis plasmid, MP6, expresses the genes dnaQ926, dam, seqA, emrR, ugi and cda1 from an arabinose-inducible promoter.
DP: drift plasmid. A plasmid in the host cells that expresses mutagenic genes upon induction with arabinose and also allows for genetic drift
through the expression of gIII upon induction with anhydrotetracycline and phage infection. The most common drift plasmid, DP6, expresses the
genes dnaQ926, dam, seqA, emrR, ugi and cda1 from an arabinose-inducible promoter and gIII from a hybrid phage shock/Tet promoter.

absolutely essential for both host cell infection and phage particle detachment during assembly, it can
be used to link POI activity and phage propagation. In PACE, gIII is provided on an accessory
plasmid (AP; Box 1)6 in the host cells, and its expression is triggered by the desired activity from the
POI encoded in its place on the SP genome (Fig. 1b). Therefore, only SP encoding an active POI can
induce pIII production and propagate faster than their rate of dilution5.

To simultaneously evolve and select for function, the host cells also contain a mutagenesis plasmid
(MP; Box 1)5,7,8. The MP subjects all DNA in the host cell to random mutagenesis, including the SP
and host cell genomes, as well as any plasmids the cell contains (i.e., the AP and MP) (Fig. 1b).
Critically, because the host cells replicate more slowly than the rate of lagoon turnover, any cells that
accumulate mutations in their plasmids or genome are washed out of the system and replaced with
fresh host cells. Thus, the only persisting genetic variation occurs in the SP, which replicates at a
much faster rate of ~15 min per life cycle9.

PACE was initially validated by evolving T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) mutants that transcribe
from the T3 promoter (PT3) (Fig. 1c)5. After 8 d of continuous evolution in PACE (corresponding to
~200 generations of T7 RNAP mutation, selection and replication), promiscuous RNAPs that could
initiate transcription from both the native (PT7) and target (PT3) promoters emerged5. Although this
initial example demonstrated the power of protein continuous evolution, the study also highlighted
limitations in the early PACE technology that were addressed through subsequent developments.

For example, applications in cellular or therapeutic contexts would likely require PACE-evolved
proteins to be highly selective to avoid detrimental off-target activity. Therefore, our laboratory
developed negative selection PACE by linking undesired activity to the expression of a dominant-
negative version of pIII, pIII-neg (Fig. 1d)10, which contains a deletion of 70 amino acids in its C
domain that results in the production of phage particles unable to detach from the host cell mem-
brane during phage assembly even in the presence of wild-type pIII11. Negative selection can be
implemented simultaneously with a positive selection during PACE such that desired activity leads to
gIII expression, and undesired activity leads to gIII-negative expression10.

The ability to simultaneously mutagenize and select for activity is a critical component for con-
tinuous evolution. Mutagenesis must occur at levels sufﬁcient to access active sequences during
selection. The initial mutagenesis plasmid, MP1, increased mutagenesis rates ~100-fold over the basal
E. coli mutation rate by expressing a dominant-negative variant of the E. coli DNA polymerase III
proofreading domain (dnaQ926) and the error-prone DNA polymerase V (polV) (Table 1)5. How-
ever, the resulting mutational rate of ~10−8 substitutions per base pair per generation was low
compared to in vitro mutagenesis techniques, impeding access to variants containing many muta-
tions1. To address this limitation, our laboratory developed inducible mutagenesis plasmids
(MP2–MP6) with a wide range of cellular mutagenesis rates (Table 1)8. These MPs increase muta-
genesis rates by expressing additional proteins that increase DNA methylation and deamination (dam
and cda1), inhibit cellular repair pathways (ugi) and retain mutagenic bases in the cell (emrR)12.
Uninduced background mutagenesis was decreased by strategically orienting the genes to remove

Fig. 1 | Overview of PACE. a, In a ﬁxed-volume vessel—the ‘lagoon’—selection phage3 encoding an evolving POI triggers gIII expression from an
accessory plasmid6 in host E. coli cells, resulting in the production of the essential phage protein pIII. The lagoon is continuously diluted with a culture
of fresh host cells. All replicating DNA within the lagoon is mutagenized via an engineered mutagenesis plasmid7 to provide genetic diversity. Only the
SP-containing genes encoding functional POI variants are capable of replicating faster than the rate of dilution, allowing them to persist in the lagoon.
b, Gene variants on the SPs that encode active POIs trigger the expression of gIII from the AP, typically through the activation or recruitment of an
RNAP. The MP expresses mutagenic genes under the control of the arabinose promoter; induction of mutagenesis occurs upon addition of arabinose
to the growth media. c, Established PACE selection strategies for various POI (blue) activities, including RNAP activity (upper left), protein:DNA
binding (upper middle), protein solubility (upper right), proteolysis of speciﬁc amino acid sequences (middle left), protein:protein binding (middle

potential unwanted promoters and by adding seqA to modulate DNA supercoiling8. In E. coli, full
induction of the most mutagenetic MP (MP6) results in a ~300,000-fold increase in the mutation rate
of chromosomal DNA (Table 1), which corresponds to ∼2.3 substitutions per kb per generation in
phage8. The greatly increased rate of mutagenesis provided by MP6 allowed evolution of T7 RNAP
variants active on the T3 promoter in less than 10 h, compared to ~200 h when using MP1.

In directed evolution, selection stringency affects both the feasibility of evolution and the activity
of surviving proteins. Selection stringency in PACE has been modulated using several strategies,
which are discussed further below: (i) changing the rate of lagoon dilution; (ii) using evolutionary
stepping stones to guide the evolving SP through a series of progressively more challenging targets;
(iii) applying drift by using a drift plasmid (DP), which mutagenizes DNA while providing pIII in a
selection-independent manner to generate diversity with little selection pressure; and (iv) adjusting
the selection circuit on the AP that relates desired activity to pIII production5,7,8,10,13–18.

Increasing the lagoon dilution rate in PACE increases the required rate of replication for SP
persistence. Thus, the SP must trigger gIII production at a higher rate, which, in turn, correlates to
higher POI activity. Because selection in PACE is kinetically controlled, POIs that act slowly can be
more difﬁcult to evolve, and ﬂow rates below 0.5 volumes/h can lead to bioﬁlm formation in pump
tubing. In these cases, PANCE can present a lower-stringency alternative18–20. PANCE uses the same
selection principles as PACE but is performed through serial dilution instead of under continuous
ﬂow (Supplementary Fig. 1a). In addition to lower stringency, PANCE also enables multiplexing of
phage-based evolution as it can be performed easily in parallel (i.e., in deep-well plates)18,21. However,
PANCE is slower and can be more time intensive than PACE.

Stepping-stone approaches are particularly useful when evolving POIs with no or minimal starting
activity7,14,17–19. In this strategy, an intermediate target encoded on a stepping-stone AP in PACE is
used to bridge the wild-type activity and desired target activity. When POI variants with activity on
the stepping-stone target can be accessed during PACE, but POI variants with activity on the ﬁnal
target are difﬁcult to access, stepping-stone strategies can increase the likelihood of successful evo-
lution. For example, a hybrid T7/T3 promoter was used to facilitate evolution of T7 RNAP to
transcribe from the T3 promoter, as wild-type T7 RNAP had no detected activity on the T3 pro-
moter5. Similarly, protease target stepping stones14, protein-binding target stepping stones7, small-
molecule substrate concentration stepping stones17,18 and DNA sequence stepping stones19,21 have
also been used to guide evolution to successful endpoints during PACE.

Another option when evolving proteins that have slow kinetics or minimal starting activity is to
implement evolutionary drift by using a DP7,15,21. DPs express the same mutagenic genes as MPs but,
in addition, express gIII from a hybrid phage shock/Tet promoter8. Induction of gIII in the presence
of mutagenesis allows for diversiﬁcation of SPs in the absence of selection pressure to produce a
starting library of mutants in the initial stages of a PACE experiment. After this drift phase, gIII
production from the DP can be reduced to increase selection pressure.

Finally, modulating stringency by tuning the selection circuit on the AP can be especially effec-
tive5,15,21,22. AP tuning tailors copy number, promoter strength, ribosome-binding site strength and
other parameters that deﬁne the relationship between target activity and gIII expression and is usually
required for optimal PACE outcomes. Optimal selection tuning usually requires insight into the basic
mechanism of the POI and will sometimes require adjustment beyond simple modiﬁcations on the
AP, such as changes to the form or expression level of the POI on the SP.

Applications of the method
PACE is, in principle, capable of evolving any protein whose activity can be linked to expression of an
essential phage gene in bacteria. In most cases, this essential phage gene is gIII; however, gVI has also
been used21,23. Phage-based continuous evolution has been used to evolve polymerases5,10,22,24–26;
and transcription factors23;
DNA-binding proteins,
protein–protein interactions,
including antibody-like proteins16 and insecticidal proteins7; pro-
teases14,27; aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases17,20; dehydrogenases18; and cytidine and deoxyadenosine
deaminases used for base editing15,16,28 (Fig. 1c).

including TALE arrays12, Cas919,21

PACE was initially applied to evolve RNAPs using APs that placed gIII expression directly under
the control of a speciﬁc promoter5. Applying this circuit in both positive and negative selection forms
resulted in the evolution of highly active T7 RNAP variants with ~10,000-fold altered selectivity for
10. PACE has also been used to evolve T7 RNAP variants tolerant to C-terminal
PT3 over PT7
fusions24. Similar approaches using phage-derived transcription factors have been reported for
phagemid-based evolution (PACEmid). In these studies, gVI was used as the selection marker because
high gIII background expression from the synthetic promoters employed rendered host cells unin-
fectable23. PACEmid also allows for the generation of large combinatorial libraries of transcription
factors and is compatible with continuous and non-continuous evolution23,29.

Evolving proteins other than polymerases requires more elaborate systems to couple protein
activity to gene expression. A modiﬁcation of the RNAP selection is a circuit in which POI DNA
binding recruits a RNAP to a promoter upstream of gIII using a one-hybrid approach12. In these

4104

NATURE PROTOCOLS

PROTOCOL

cases, the POI is linked to the ω subunit of E. coli RNAP (rpoZ) such that successful DNA binding
recruits endogenous RNAP to enable gIII transcription from a nearby weak promoter. This strategy
was used to evolve TALE array proteins12 and Cas9 variants19,21 with increased DNA speciﬁcity or
altered DNA recognition requirements.

Analogously, a two-hybrid system can be used to evolve protein–protein interactions in PACE by
linking the POI (prey) to rpoZ and the bait to a DNA-binding protein such as the 434 cI phage
repressor7. Our laboratory has used such a selection to evolve the insecticidal toxin Cry1Ac to bind a
non-native receptor found in an insect pest resistant to the wild-type toxin7 and antibody-like
proteins with improved soluble expression16.

In addition to recruitment, PACE selections can use polymerase activation by the POI to trigger
gIII expression and phage propagation. For example, our laboratory created a selection for protease
activity by ﬁrst inactivating T7 RNAP through tethering to its natural inhibitor T7 lysozyme and then
placing a substrate for proteolysis in the linker region between the two proteins, thus rendering
liberation of T7 RNAP and transcription of gIII from PT7 dependent on protease cleavage of the
target substrate in the linker. This selection was used to evolve drug-resistant HCV proteases27, as
well as a TEV protease variant that recognizes and cleaves human interleukin-23 (ref. 14). T7 RNAP
can also be inactivated by splitting into two halves. Split T7 RNAP complementation has been used as
a folding reporter selection to evolve proteins with improved soluble expression16, as well as to select
protein–protein interaction-dependent RNAPs24,25.

Modiﬁcations to the sequence of T7 RNAP can result in inactivation that is then corrected by POI
activity. For example, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases were evolved in PACE using amber suppression
of premature stop codons in the T7 RNAP gene, as well as in gIII itself17. This selection was used to
improve the selectivity of a promiscuous aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase toward incorporation of
p-iodophenylalanine. T7 RNAP activation through sequence modiﬁcation can also be used to evolve
DNA-modifying enzymes. For example, T7 RNAP inactivated through C-terminal fusion to a degron
was used to evolve cytidine deaminases in base editors that could introduce a stop codon in the linker
region through a successful C-to-T transition15. A similar approach was used to evolve deox-
yadenosine deaminases in base editors that could ﬁx a stop codon placed within the coding region of
T7 RNAP28. These selections yielded new deaminase variants with increased activity and altered
target sequence compatibility.

PACE can also be used to evolve proteins that act on small molecules, such as enzymes involved in
metabolite biosynthesis. Our laboratory recently evolved methanol dehydrogenase (Mdh) variants
with increased activity18. Mdh activity was linked to gIII production through use of a formaldehyde-
responsive promoter. This work was also a key example of using PANCE as a strategy for evolving
POIs with poor starting activity.

Comparisons with other methods
Although many methods exist for discrete in vitro evolution, only a few examples of continuous
directed evolution systems have been reported. These systems typically employ either viral vectors or
orthogonal error-prone replication systems2. PACE and other phage/phagemid-based systems are the
only bacterial continuous evolution methods available. Although continuous evolution using con-
tinuous ﬂow enables remarkably fast evolution times (often reaching dozens of generations per 24 h)
with minimal researcher intervention, it limits the scope of evolvable POIs toward those that can
express and function in bacterial cells.

Liu and co-workers created a system for continuous evolution in yeast (OrthoRep) that uses a
linear plasmid system replicated using a dedicated DNA polymerase (DNAP1) orthogonal to
endogenous yeast polymerases30–32. DNAP1 was engineered to increase its mutagenesis rate to exceed
genomic error thresholds. As an initial example, OrthoRep was used to evolve drug resistant variants
of malarial dihydrofolate reductases (DHFR)31. Like PACE, this system selects for organismal survival
and should accommodate any selection that can link the activity of interest with yeast propagation.
Although theoretically slower than PACE, OrthoRep enables continuous evolution in a eukaryotic
system33 and should be compatible with POIs that require more complex post-translational
modiﬁcation or that can only be expressed functionally in eukaryotic cells.

Continuous evolution systems have also been developed for mammalian cells by relying on viral
life cycles to mutagenize and transfer genetic information. To date, two viruses, adenovirus type 5 and
the RNA virus Sindbis, have been used for mammalian continuous evolution. Shoulders and co-
workers used an engineered adenovirus type 5 with both its dedicated DNA polymerase (AdPol) and

NATURE PROTOCOLS

essential protease (AdProt) deleted from its genome6. Instead, an engineered error-prone AdPol
variant (~10−6 mutations per bp per generation) and AdProt are provided by the mammalian cell
genome. The evolving POI encoded on the viral genome is selected for its ability to trigger expression
of AdProt and therefore viral propagation. This system was used to evolve doxycycline-resistant
tetracycline transactivator proteins. Roth and co-workers engineered the Sindbis virus to remove the
capsid proteins E1, E2 and E3 from the viral genome and instead encode a POI34. These proteins are
then provided in a POI activity-dependent manner on a vector in the mammalian cell host.
Diversiﬁcation is achieved by the naturally error-prone Sindbis viral RNA-dependent RNA poly-
merase, which is capable of mutagenizing the viral RNA genome at ~10-4 mutations per bp per
generation. This system, known as ‘viral evolution of genetically actuating sequences’ (VEGAS), has
been used successfully to evolve transcription factors, GPCRs and nanobodies.

Limitations of PACE
Although the versatility of PACE has been demonstrated through its application to many classes of
proteins, evolution of a given POI using PACE is possible only if its desired activity can be linked to
gene transcription in bacteria. The selection circuit resulting from this coupling must have good
dynamic range: we suggest activation of at least ten-fold. Furthermore, as low levels of pIII expression
will render a host cell uninfectable9, the selection circuit must possess low background gIII expression
levels or, alternatively, use a different phage gene, such as gVI in place of gIII21,23.

Because the POI must be made faithfully in the E. coli cytosol, poor folding or the requirement for
post-translational modiﬁcations, such as disulﬁde bond formation or complex glycosylation, will
preclude evolution using PACE. Another limitation on the POI is imposed by the packaging limit of
the SP (~11-kb max, corresponding to a ~5-kb limit on the POI/POIs)9. Thus, very large proteins or
protein clusters might be unsuitable for PACE. To date, the largest single protein that has been
evolved in PACE is ω-dSpCas9 (~4.4 kb)19,21.

PACE selections involving small-molecule substrates can be challenging to implement. The small
molecule must be either synthesized by the host cell or readily cell permeable and available at a
sufﬁciently high concentration to sustain the selection. In the case of exogenous addition, a large
quantity of small molecule might be required since a single PACE experiment can turn over >10 L of
media; substrate cost can therefore limit the evolution of enzymes that catalyze transformations of
precious small molecules. Additionally, free diffusion of a given enzymatic product between host cells
can signiﬁcantly complicate selections by triggering or repressing gene circuits in trans. In some cases,
local concentrations of product molecules (such as formaldehyde in the methanol dehydrogenase
example described above18) can activate gene circuits before their diffusion and dilution takes place,
or an exogenous chemical sink can be used to limit in trans circuit modulation18.

Finally, selection in PACE takes place very rapidly, as a complete phage life cycle typically requires
only ~15–30 min9. If the activity of interest proceeds more slowly than phage replication, selection in
PACE could prove too stringent, even when lagoon ﬂow rates are minimized and selection circuits are
optimized.

Experimental design
The overall ﬂow of the Procedure is shown in Fig. 2.

Preparation of PACE host cells and phage (Steps 1–50)
Like other members of the Inovirus genus, M13 ﬁlamentous bacteriophage form long, pilus-like
particles of various coat proteins encasing a circular, single-stranded genome9,35. Eleven phage
proteins (gI–gXI) are encoded on the wild-type genome; the engineered SPs used in PACE encode all
of these, except for gIII. The SP genome can be transformed as circular double-stranded DNA into
host cells that provide gIII in trans to produce fully packaged and infectious phage particles.
Accordingly, both cloning and expansion of SP stocks are typically performed using strain S2208
(Box 1), which contains a plasmid (pJC175e) that supplies gIII under the control of the phage shock
promoter5. Typically, after transformation or transduction into S2208 followed by a period of
overnight growth to allow propagation, SP particles can be easily isolated by collecting the culture
supernatant and passing it through a 0.22-µm ﬁlter to remove any residual host cells. The con-
centration of phage particles (titer) in SP stocks can be determined by performing a plaque assay
using S2208 cells (Steps 18–22). Additionally, as the SPs in each plaque are clonal, picking individual

several rounds of engineering5,10,12. Modiﬁcations include deletion of ﬂu, pgaC and csgABCDEFG to
substantially reduce bioﬁlming and deletion of rpoZ to enable the use of n-hybrid systems using
fusions to the RNAP ω subunit. Furthermore, S2060 cells contain an F plasmid, which allows phage
infection via the expressed F pilus, modiﬁed to incorporate lacI, tetR and luxCDE, as well as lacZ
under the control of the phage shock promoter. Phage infection triggers transcription from the phage
shock promoter, leading to lacZ production that enables colorimetric visualization of phage infection
or plaque activity by addition of Bluo-Gal or related substrates to the growth media.

Before starting a PACE experiment, we recommend benchmarking the starting activity of the SP
using S2060s transformed with the AP and CP, if using. Overnight propagation experiments in the
absence of mutagenesis (Steps 35–39) can be performed with these cells to estimate the ability of the
starting SP to survive under conditions of continuous ﬂow. We discovered empirically that SP will
persist in a lagoon at a ﬂow rate of 0.5 volumes/h if their overnight propagation on the host cells

equals or exceeds ~103-fold. Typically, 102- to 103-fold overnight propagation is sufﬁcient activity to
begin a PACE experiment with the expectation that any SPs that acquire a ﬁtness-increasing mutation
will be able to persist in the system. Selections with lower than 102-fold overnight propagation levels
may still be used to initiate a PACE experiment by enabling an initial period of evolutionary drift
using a DP. On the other hand, overnight propagation magnitudes that equal or exceed 105-fold
imply signiﬁcant starting activity of the POI and suggest that selection stringency should be increased
before PACE is attempted.

MPs8 are always transformed immediately before a PACE experiment, as increased background
mutagenesis due to the leakiness of the arabinose promoter can lead to slow accumulation of
mutations in host cells over time. To help prevent leaky expression of MP components, strains
containing the MP or DP are always grown using glucose-containing media to further repress the
arabinose promoter and are never stored for more than 1 week. Similarly, after their initial cloning,
the SPs used in PACE are re-isolated before being used to infect the lagoons in a process we
term ‘puriﬁcation’ (Steps 46–50). SP puriﬁcation decreases the likelihood of random recombination
with host cell-encoded gIII to produce recombinant phage in the SP stock that can rapidly poison a
PACE experiment.

Setting up the PACE apparatus (Steps 51–71)
The lagoons in PACE are continually diluted with host cell culture at a ﬂow rate that is faster than the
rate of host cell division but slower than the replication rate of propagating phage. Continuous
dilution is implemented by using two peristaltic pumps to cycle the chemostat (host cell culture) and
the lagoons, respectively. The chemostat is diluted with fresh media to maintain constant cell density,
thus ensuring that F pilus expression in the host cells is preserved, whereas the lagoons are diluted
with fresh host cells from the chemostat for SP infection and propagation. Induction of the muta-
genesis plasmid present in the host cells occurs solely in the lagoons such that the phage experience a
high rate of mutagenesis while the chemostat cells remain un-mutagenized.

This protocol lists all necessary materials and instructions for setting up a PACE experiment using
one chemostat and two lagoons (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 2). We typically perform PACE
experiments in 2–4 replicate lagoons, where one chemostat provides host cells to multiple identical
lagoons evolving at the same time. Although this protocol can be scaled to multiple chemostats,
because of the resource-intensive nature of PACE, running many evolutions in parallel can be

PROTOCOL

challenging. If a high degree of parallelization or throughput is required, PANCE might offer an
attractive alternative (Steps 106–116).

Initiating PACE (Steps 72–83)
The initial stage of M13 phage infection involves binding of pIII to the F pilus9. Because expression of
the F pilus decreases when temperatures are lower than 37 °C and when cells enter the late expo-
nential stage of growth, maintaining the host cells at 37 °C and in mid-exponential growth in the
chemostat is critical for the success of a PACE experiment. Mutagenesis and drift, if used, should be
induced in the lagoon host cells at least 1 h before infection with phage. This delay allows for
adequate time for the host cells to begin expressing the mutagenic factors from the MP. Immediately
after SP addition, the ﬂow in and out of the lagoons is temporarily halted to allow infection to occur
in the absence of dilution. Flow is typically resumed ~10 min after infection.

Monitoring PACE (Steps 84–97)
The infection of lagoons with SP marks the beginning of the PACE experiment. After this point, the
researcher should monitor the titer of phage in each lagoon to inform adjustments to ﬂow rate or drift
induction (Fig. 4a). During the course of the PACE experiment, samples of the lagoons can be drawn.
We typically remove ~1 ml of culture from the lagoon every 8–16 h to determine the lagoon phage
titer or to sequence the evolving gene pool.

Phage titer can be estimated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (Steps 117–124);
however, the most precise way to measure titer is through plaque assays (Steps 18–22) (Fig. 4b). A
drop in lagoon phage titer (reduction of ten-fold or greater) is typically associated with POIs with
little or no activity. A lagoon with a phage titer at or below ~103 plaque-forming units (pfu)/ml is
considered to have ‘washed out’: as library size is proportionate to SP population size, such a small
phage population may be unlikely to ﬁnd a ﬁtness-increasing mutation to recover. Conversely, an
increase in lagoon titer (expansion of ten-fold or greater) often indicates the acquisition of a ﬁtness-
increasing mutation.

Thus, lagoon ﬂow rates should be increased if titers either remain stable (suggesting a lack of
selection pressure) or increase (Fig. 4a). We suggest increasing ﬂow rates in increments of 0.5–1
volume/h. After such an increase, lagoon titers will usually drop. A recovery of titer after such a
decrease can signify an increase in ﬁtness from the acquisition of beneﬁcial mutations. In the course
of a typical PACE, ﬂow rate is increased every 24–48 h, with rates ranging between 0.5 and 3 volumes/
h. As replication time of M13 phage is proportionate to genome size, SPs carrying smaller POIs
replicate faster and can persist at higher rates of dilution compared to SPs encoding larger POIs.

If using drift, the researcher should expect lagoon phage titers to remain consistently high (108
pfu/ml or greater) during DP induction (Fig. 4c). Decreases in titer are typically observed after drift is
discontinued; however, if a solution that improves ﬁtness has been found, titers should increase
subsequently. Once the lagoons reach a ﬂow rate of 3 volumes/h or higher while maintaining a high
titer of phage, it is unlikely that further improvements in POI ﬁtness will be achieved without
changing selection stringency in ways other than increasing ﬂow rate. At this point, we recommend
ending the PACE experiment.

Characterization of evolved phage (Steps 98–105)
Clonal phage from lagoon samples can be isolated using plaque assays. These assays can be performed
in either a POI activity-independent (with S2208 cells, Steps 18–22) or POI activity-dependent
manner (with host cells containing the APs used for evolution, Steps 37–41). The latter option can be
advantageous as it selects for SP encoding POIs with robust activity on the selection circuit encoded
by the AP.

The POI can be directly ampliﬁed by PCR from plaques and the resulting PCR product can be
used for Sanger DNA sequencing (Steps 26–29). We typically sequence at least eight plaques from the
last PACE sample collected per lagoon, although we will often sequence plaques from earlier samples
to arrive at a clearer picture of when speciﬁc mutations arose, if they arose simultaneously with other
mutations or independently and if the solutions found are similar across different replicates (lagoons)
of the same evolution.

Although there are many ways to validate the activity of evolved POIs, the simplest way to
compare between multiple phage clones is to perform luciferase assays (Steps 100–105). In most APs
cloned in our laboratory, pIII is translationally coupled to bacterial luciferase, allowing POI activity to
be estimated by infecting host cells with an excess of phage and using luminescence as an

approximate readout for gIII expression (Supplementary Fig. 1b). An alternative approach is to
subclone promising hits into an expression plasmid for use with this luciferase assay.

PANCE (Steps 106–116)
PANCE uses the same selection strategies as PACE but with iterative dilution of lagoons instead of
continuous dilution (Supplementary Fig. 1a)18–20. PANCE might be a good alternative to PACE for
POIs that have low or slow activity or when a higher throughput is desired. The lower-stringency
nature of PANCE comes from the increased time allowed for phage propagation: whereas the lagoons
in PACE are turned over every ~20 min to 2 h, PANCE allows phage to incubate with the same host
cells for 6–18 h. As a result, evolution in PANCE is much slower than in PACE.

Parallel evolution is more easily achieved using PANCE than PACE. Although PACE becomes
prohibitive in space, equipment and cost once several chemostat/lagoon pairs are running simulta-
neously, PANCE can be easily performed in 96-well deep-well plates18. PANCE in multi-well plates
enables the parallel evolution toward many different targets or many replicates of the same evolution.
Increasing the number of simultaneous evolutions can make determination of phage titers tedious

owing to the large number of plaque assays required. For this reason, we often use a qPCR method for
phage titer determination when faced with a large number of samples (Steps 117–124).

In place of lagoon ﬂow rate adjustments, stringency in PANCE can be modulated by changing the
dilution factor of the phage or the incubation time. PANCE is also compatible with drift; however, we
do not recommend performing drift for longer than 6–8 h as it might lead to an increase in gIII
recombination.

PROTOCOL

NATURE PROTOCOLS

c CRITICAL STEP Cells containing MP6 or DP6 should always be plated on and cultured in media
containing glucose (i.e., DRM) to suppress mutagenesis of host strains. Cells containing MP6 or
DP6 should be transformed immediately before a PACE experiment and should never be stored
longer than 1 week at 4 °C.
j PAUSE POINT Ideally, cells transformed with MP6 or DP6 should be used immediately but can
be stored up to 1 week at 4 °C.

42 The day before starting a PACE experiment, pick a single colony of PACE host cells into 1 ml of
DRM containing the appropriate antibiotics. Then, either in individual culture tubes or in the wells
of a 96-well deep-well plate, create eight 1:10 serial dilutions of this resuspended colony. Incubate in
a biological shaker at 37 °C for 16–20 h.

43 The next morning, select a serially diluted culture of PACE host cells that is in mid-log phase
(OD600 of 0.2–0.8) and use this culture to inoculate 30–40 ml of DRM containing the appropriate
antibiotics in either a 100-ml bafﬂe ﬂask or a Corning Mini Bioreactor Centrifuge Tube.

44 Grow this larger culture in a biological shaker at 37 °C until

(OD600 ~0.2–0.8).

it reaches mid-log phase

45 Use this culture to start chemostats (Step 72).

c CRITICAL STEP To ensure maximum phage infectibility, host cells should never surpass
OD600 = 0.8.

the entire cross-section in 2 ml of DRM without antibiotics.

48 Incubate in a biological shaker for 6–8 h or until the culture reaches mid-log phase (OD600 of

0.2–0.8).

49 Isolate phage by pelleting the cells by centrifuging at 8,000g for 2 min and then collecting and
ﬁltering the supernatant using a 3-ml syringe ﬁtted with a 13-mm, 0.22-μm PVDF syringe ﬁlter to
remove residual cells.

can gradually decrease over time.

50 Determine the phage titer using an activity-independent phage plaque assay (Steps 18–22).

c CRITICAL STEP This step prepares an SP stock that can be used to infect a PACE experiment (in
Step 81) with reduced likelihood of producing wild-type recombinants (SPs whose genomes have
re-acquired gIII through recombination with the gIII sequence present on either APs or pJC175e in
S2208 cells), which will quickly poison a PACE experiment.

lagoons and tubing are kept sterile until the experiment begins.

Preparation of DRM carboy ● Timing 2 h
65 To 9.75 L of water in a 10-L Nalgene heavy duty polypropylene carboy with a Nalgene
polypropylene 3-port ﬁlling/venting closure cap, add 181 g of Harvard Custom Media A and 10 ml
of TWEEN-20.

66 Attach three 5-in segments of 1/4-in i.d. Masterﬂex BPT tubing (5a) to the three ports on the top
side of the cap. Insert one female (7b) and two male (6d) 1/4-in i.d. Luer adapters into the tubing
(Fig. 3d). Cap one male Luer adapter, and place foil over the other ends for autoclaving.

67 Attach one 30-in segment of 1/4-in i.d. Masterﬂex BPT tubing (5b) to the underside of the cap so
that it is attached to the other side of the 5-in segment containing the female Luer adapter (Fig. 3d).

j PAUSE POINT Sterilized carboys containing Harvard Custom Media A can be stored at room
temperature for up to 3 months.

69 Separately, add Harvard Custom Media C (59 g), 50 µl of 0.1 M CaCl2 solution, 120 µl of Trace
Metals solution and any appropriate antibiotics to 250 ml of water. Mix to dissolve all solids and
then sterilize using a Corning bottle-top vacuum ﬁlter system.

70 Add the ﬁltered Harvard Custom Media C solution to the cooled Harvard Custom Media A

solution in the carboy and mix to combine.

Setting up the PACE experiment ● Timing 1 d
72 Transfer 30 ml of the OD600 ~0.2–0.8 culture of host cells prepared in Step 45 to the chemostat.
73 Connect the media to the chemostat: connect the longer (incoming) segment of part C attached to

pump 1 to the female Luer adapter on the media carboy (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 2b).

74 Connect the chemostat to waste: connect the outgoing segment of part E attached to pump 1 to the

waste (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 2b).

75 Begin media ﬂow into the chemostat. Hold the rapid dispense button on pump 1 until media begins
ﬂowing into the chemostat. Adjust the height of the waste needle (part 14 attached to part E) in the
chemostat to maintain an approximate volume of 40 ml. The waste needle should never be lower
than the needle for lagoon outﬂow (part 14 attached to part D). Set the ﬂow rate of pump 1 to 40
ml/h (1 volume/h) and allow the chemostat to turn over at a ﬂow rate of 1 volume/h for at least 1 h
to ensure that the chemostat OD600 is maintained at 0.4–0.6.

76 Connect the lagoons to waste: connect the outgoing end of each part E attached to pump 2 to the

waste (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 2b).

77 Fill the lagoons. Hold the rapid dispense button on pump 2 until the chemostat cell culture begin to
ﬂow into the lagoons. Adjust the height of the waste needle (part 14 attached to part E) in each
lagoon to maintain an approximate volume of 15 ml. Set the ﬂow rate of pump 2 to 15 ml/h (1
volume/h) and allow lagoons to turn over at a ﬂow rate of 1 volume/h for at least 1 h to ensure that
the steady-state chemostat volume is unchanged.
? TROUBLESHOOTING

78 Prepare induction syringes (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 2b). Add 50 ml of 250 mM arabinose to
each 50-ml syringe (Note: both syringes must be ﬁlled with the same volume of solution). If
inducing drift from DP6, add anhydrotetracycline concentration (aTc) to the arabinose solution to
the desired ﬁnal concentration. The rate of aTc addition typically ranges between 0 and 50 ng/ml/h
(Fig. 4b). Attach the female Luer adapters of the inducer lines (21) to the syringes. Place syringes in
the syringe pump. Connect the male Luer adapters of the inducer lines (21) to the other part 13 in
each lagoon (A).

79 Clear the air from the inducer lines by turning on the syringe pump and setting a high ﬂow rate
(e.g., 10 ml/h). Allow the syringe pump to pump until the inducer lines are ﬁlled with inducer
solution and ~0.6 ml of inducer solution has been added to each lagoon.

0.6 ml/h. Allow the arabinose (or arabinose and aTc) solution to pump for at least 1 h before
infecting the lagoons with phage.

81 Infect lagoons. Fill two 1-ml syringes with 1 ml of 107 pfu/ml puriﬁed SP in DRM (see Steps 46–50
for phage puriﬁcation). Stop all pumps. Disconnect the lagoon waste lines (E) from the lagoon
16-G × 4-in waste needles. Inject 1 ml of the 107 pfu/ml SP directly into each lagoon (A) through
the 16-G × 4-in waste needles. Reconnect the male Luer adapters from the lagoon waste lines (E) to
the lagoon 16-G × 4-in waste needles. Wait 10 min before collecting the ﬁrst sample from the
lagoon or turning on the pumps.

82 Collect a sample from each lagoon (following Steps 84–87). This sample corresponds to the

0-h timepoint.

83 Turn on pump 2 to begin the PACE experiment. We typically start at a lagoon ﬂow rate of
0.5 volumes/h (pump 2: 7.5 ml/h; syringe pump: 0.3 ml/h) and increase ﬂow rates as the
experiment continues (see Steps 88–90).

Taking samples from lagoons ● Timing 10 min
84 Disconnect the lagoon waste lines (E) from the lagoon 16-G × 4-in waste needles.
85 Fit 3-ml syringes to each 16-G × 4-in waste needle and draw up ~1 ml from each lagoon.
86 Reconnect the male Luer adapters from the lagoon waste lines (E) to the lagoon 16-G × 4-in waste

needles.

87 Transfer lagoon samples to Eppendorf tubes and isolate the phage (Step 24). Samples should be

taken approximately every 12 or 24 h.

Maintaining a PACE experiment ● Timing ~7 d

89 Increase the ﬂow rate by 0.5–1 volumes/h when titers either remain constant or increase over the

span of ~24 h (Fig. 4a).

90 The experiment can be discontinued when titers remain constant (or fall below detection) for over

12 h at a ﬂow rate exceeding 3 volumes/h.
? TROUBLESHOOTING

Dismantling the PACE apparatus ● Timing 3 h
91 Disconnect Part C from the media carboy and Part D from the chemostat and place them directly

into a 1-L bottle containing a solution of 10% bleach in water.

92 Continue to run the peristaltic pumps to ﬂush the system with ~500 ml of the bleach solution.
93 Swap the bleach solution for a 1-L bottle containing water and continue to run the pumps to ﬂush

~500 ml of water through the system.

94 Stop the pumps.
95 Detach all PACE tubing from pump heads and disconnect the chemostats and lagoons. Dispose of
needles securely in a sharps container. Soak tubing and chemostat components in a solution of 10%
bleach in water for 20 min.
c CRITICAL STEP We have found that autoclaving or sterilization with ethanol is insufﬁcient to
destroy phage particles. Therefore, to avoid contaminating between PACE runs, we strongly
recommend disinfecting all reused parts thoroughly with 10% bleach in water solution.

96 Rinse tubing and chemostat components several times with water to remove all traces of bleach.
97 Air dry the PACE tubing.

c CRITICAL STEP PACE tubing and chemostats may be reused but should be sterilized again ﬁrst
(Steps 54–56).

Isolating and sequencing single clones from lagoon samples ● Timing 1 d
98 Clonal phage from lagoon samples can be isolated using an activity-independent plaque assay
(Steps 18–22) or, if the POI encoded on the phage is sufﬁciently active, using an activity-dependent
plaque assay with host cells containing the appropriate AP(s) and CP(s), if applicable (Steps 35–39).
Phage are grown as in Steps 23–25.

Characterization of evolved phage by bacterial luciferase assay (optional) ● Timing 3-4 d
100 Transform S2060 host cells with the relevant AP(s)/CP(s) (Steps 1–13). The AP(s) should contain

bacterial luciferase (luxAB) translationally coupled to gIII (Supplementary Fig. 1b).

101 Pick a single colony of the host cells into DRM supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics and

incubate in a biological shaker at 37 °C for 16–20 h.

102 Make a 1:100 dilution of the resultant saturated culture of host cells into DRM supplemented with
the appropriate antibiotics and incubate in a biological shaker at 37 °C until the diluted culture
reaches an OD600 of 0.4–0.6.

103 Infect the host cells with clonal phage isolated from PACE samples at a 10:1 phage:host cell ratio.
104 Incubate cells in a biological shaker at 37 °C for 1–2 h.
105 Read luminescence using a plate reader using the following settings:

○ Set temperature to 37 °C.
○ Shake (orbital) for 10 s with 1-mm amplitude and 582 r.p.m.
○ Read absorbance at 600 nm (number ﬂashes = 10, settle time = 0 ms).
○ Read luminescence (attenuation = none, settle time = 0 ms, integration time = 500 ms).

PANCE (optional) ● Timing 1 d per passage
106 To generate host cells for PANCE, transform either MP6 or DP6 into S2060 cells containing desired

AP(s)/CP(s) as described in Steps 1–13.

107 Plate on Petri dishes containing 2× YT agar supplemented with 100 mM glucose and the

appropriate antibiotics.
c CRITICAL STEP Cells containing MP6 or DP6 should always be plated on and cultured in media
containing glucose (i.e., DRM) to suppress mutagenesis of host strains. Cells containing MP6 or
DP6 should be transformed immediately before a PANCE experiment and should never be stored
longer than 1 week at 4 °C.

108 Pick a single colony of the host cells into DRM supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics and

incubate in a biological shaker at 37 °C for 16–20 h.

109 Make a 1:100 dilution of the resultant saturated culture of host cells into DRM supplemented with
the appropriate antibiotics and incubate in a biological shaker at 37 °C until the diluted culture
reaches an OD600 of 0.4–0.6 (Supplementary Fig. 1a).

110 Induce mutagenesis and drift (if using DP6) by adding L-arabinose and aTc to a ﬁnal concentration
of 10 mM and 50 ng/µl, respectively. The aTc concentration can be adjusted between 0 and 50 ng/µl
to vary the amount of drift.

111 Infect the culture with the desired SP at a ﬁnal titer of 106–107 pfu/ml. Infection at higher starting
titers lowers the stringency of selection by reducing the fold propagation required for the SP to
persist in PANCE.

112 Incubate in a biological shaker for 6–18 h at 37 °C. Longer incubation times lower the stringency of

selection by providing more time for phage propagation.

113 Isolate phage by pelleting the cells by centrifuging at 8,000g for 2 min and then collecting and
ﬁltering the supernatant using a 3-ml syringe ﬁtted with a 13-mm, 0.22-μm PVDF syringe ﬁlter to
remove residual cells.

114 Repeat Steps 108–112 by using the phage pool to infect the next passage of induced host cells
(Supplementary Fig. 1a) and adjusting starting titer (in other words, the dilution factor of the phage
pool from the previous passage), drift induction and incubation time as desired to increase selection
stringency.

115 The titers of the PANCE phage pools after each passage can be determined either by an activity-

independent plaque assay (Steps 18–22) or by qPCR (Steps 117–124).

116 If the phage pools resulting from PANCE exhibit high propagation in phage propagation assays
using host cells transformed with the appropriate AP(s)/CP(s) (Steps 1–13; approximately >50-fold
propagation is suggested in order to perform PACE without drift or >5-fold propagation with drift)
or trigger high luciferase expression in luciferase assays (Steps 100–105, a less-quantitative proxy
for gIII expression and phage propagation), they can be used to start a PACE experiment.
Alternatively, clonal phage can be isolated from advanced PANCE pools (Step 113) and analyzed by
Sanger sequencing (Steps 26–29).

PACE experiments are typically performed for up to 7 d, although, with care, they can run for several
weeks. During PACE, lagoon titers typically range between 105 and 108 pfu/ml. Titers will vary
depending on ﬁtness, the selection circuit and POI size. During the experiment, titers should drop
and recover as selection pressure is increased and the evolving phage pool discovers ﬁtness-increasing
mutations in response to changing selection conditions. Drops in phage titer are often observed
within 12–24 h of the initial phage infection, ﬂow rate increases or cessation of drift induction. If the
SPs discover ﬁtness-increasing mutations, their titers should recover within an additional 12–24 h.
Phage titers might also remain stable throughout a PACE experiment even if ﬂow rate is increased.
This observation might indicate that the selection stringency is too low, given the properties of the
current evolved genes, to support the additional evolution of improved activity.

PACE experiments might fail in a variety of ways. For example, lagoon phage titers might drop
below a limit (~102–103 pfu/ml) beyond which recovery is either extremely unlikely or impossible.
This ‘phage washout’ can occur when the selection is too stringent or if the host cells are uninfectable.
Another possible failure mode is recombination of gIII into the SP genome, which leads to phage that
can short-circuit the selection and therefore rapidly take over the lagoon population. Recombination
is frequently accompanied by the loss of the now-dispensable POI insert, which can be detected by a
decrease in the size of the corresponding PCR ampliﬁcation product (Step 27). Strategies for
addressing these failures are listed in the Troubleshooting (Table 2).

After completion of a PACE or PANCE experiment, mutations that might have accumulated in
the POI can be identiﬁed by sequencing clonal SPs isolated from lagoon samples at later timepoints
(PACE) or passages (PANCE). We recommend sequencing the POI encoded by eight or more clonal
phage to allow for identiﬁcation of consensus mutations. Mutations can accumulate in both the SP
backbone and the POI gene insert. The number of mutations observed will vary from selection to
selection and can be inﬂuenced by factors such as selection stringency, POI size, the duration of the
PACE/PANCE experiment and the nature of the POI itself. Additionally, signiﬁcant increases in
ﬁtness can occur simply because of mutations in the SP backbone that optimize replication efﬁciency.
Observation of a low number of consensus mutations does not preclude a successful evolution, as POI
activity can be increased by just a single mutation. However, a lack of any shared mutations altogether
might indicate that the evolution lacked sufﬁcient stringency to enrich for POI variants with
improved ﬁtness or that a large fraction of sequence space contains variants with sufﬁcient ﬁtness to
survive the present selection conditions.

The outcome of an evolution experiment can be quickly assessed using either bacterial luciferase
(Steps 100–105) or activity-dependent phage propagation assays (Steps 35–39); activity in these
assays should increase for both the evolved SP pool and isolated SP clones relative to SP encoding the
wild-type or starting POI. Ultimately, individual POI variants isolated from a PACE or PANCE
experiment should be assessed using appropriate and orthogonal activity assays.

Reporting Summary

Nature Research wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish. This form provides structure for consistency and transparency 
in reporting. For further information on Nature Research policies, see our Editorial Policies and the Editorial Policy Checklist.

Statistics
For all statistical analyses, confirm that the following items are present in the figure legend, table legend, main text, or Methods section.

n/a Confirmed

The exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement

A statement on whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly
The statistical test(s) used AND whether they are one- or two-sided 
Only common tests should be described solely by name; describe more complex techniques in the Methods section.
A description of all covariates tested

A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as tests of normality and adjustment for multiple comparisons

A full description of the statistical parameters including central tendency (e.g. means) or other basic estimates (e.g. regression coefficient) 
AND variation (e.g. standard deviation) or associated estimates of uncertainty (e.g. confidence intervals)

For null hypothesis testing, the test statistic (e.g. F, t, r) with confidence intervals, effect sizes, degrees of freedom and P value noted 
Give P values as exact values whenever suitable.

For Bayesian analysis, information on the choice of priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settings

For hierarchical and complex designs, identification of the appropriate level for tests and full reporting of outcomes

Estimates of effect sizes (e.g. Cohen's d, Pearson's r), indicating how they were calculated

Our web collection on statistics for biologists contains articles on many of the points above.

Software and code
