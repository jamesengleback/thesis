De novo protein design has succeeded in generating a large
variety of globular proteins, but the construction of protein
scaffolds with cavities that could accommodate large signaling
molecules, cofactors, and substrates remains an outstanding chal-
lenge. The long, often flexible loops that form such cavities in
many natural proteins are difficult to precisely program and thus
challenging for computational protein design. Here we describe an
alternative approach to this problem. We fused two stable
proteins with C2 symmetry—a de novo designed dimeric ferre-
doxin fold and a de novo designed TIM barrel—such that their
symmetry axes are aligned to create scaffolds with large cavities
that can serve as binding pockets or enzymatic reaction chambers.
The crystal structures of two such designs confirm the presence of
a 420 cubic Ångström chamber defined by the top of the designed
TIM barrel and the bottom of the ferredoxin dimer. We functional-
ized the scaffold by installing a metal-binding site consisting of four
glutamate residues close to the symmetry axis. The protein binds
lanthanide ions with very high affinity as demonstrated by
tryptophan-enhanced terbium luminescence. This approach can be
extended to other metals and cofactors, making this scaffold a mod-
ular platform for the design of binding proteins and biocatalysts.

protein design

The TIM barrel fold is among the most versatile enzyme
scaffolds in nature (1, 2). It consists of eight parallel β-strands
surrounded by eight α-helices in a (β/α)8 topology. The parallel
β-strands confer a polarity to the domain—a “top” and “bot-
tom.” Enzyme active sites in nature are usually located at the
center of the top (3), where side chains from all eight strands are
directed toward the center of the barrel. Additional substrate-
binding components are typically formed from irregular, ex-
tended loops that connect the strands and helices (4). Below the
active site, an extensive hydrophobic core between the β-barrel
and the α-helices provides considerable stability, allowing TIM
barrel active sites to diversify with minimal effects on overall fold
stability (5).

The engineering of natural TIM barrels, both by directed
evolution and design, has resulted in enzymes with altered sub-
strate
and even
new-to-nature chemistries (6–13). The de novo design of cata-
lytic functions, however, has been challenged in part by the dif-
ficulty in programming flexible loops;
the most successful
approaches to date have reused loops found in nature (14, 15).
An artificial TIM barrel designed with atomic-level accuracy was
created previously using the Rosetta macromolecular and design
platform (16, 17). This protein (sTIM11), which has no native
function and no natural sequence homologs, was created by re-
peating four copies of a 46-amino acid (β/α)2 unit about a central
symmetry axis. It was expressed as a single chain, but the internal

symmetry left open the possibility of converting the barrel into a
homotetramer or homodimer by expressing one or
two
46-residue repeats, then allowing these parts to self-assemble in
solution to form a complete TIM barrel. More recently, this
scaffold has been reengineered to improve thermodynamic and
kinetic stability, yielding a series of improved variants dubbed
DeNovoTIMs (18). De novo protein design is inspired by but not
limited to nature’s solutions. To generate a protein scaffold that
might support the incorporation of catalytic cofactors, we aimed
for an alternative to loop design: fusing ordered protein domains
directly on top of a DeNovoTIM variant.

including metal

Many natural proteins require a metal ion to carry out their
function. Such metalloproteins are involved in numerous bio-
logical processes,
ion storage and transport,
sensing and signaling, electron transfer pathways, and catalysis.
Computationally designed proteins may serve as a starting point
to engineer artificial metalloproteins with specific binding sites
for a metal ion of choice. Thus, in addition to engineering a
suitable lid atop DeNovoTIM, we set out to introduce a de novo
metal-binding site for large, trivalent lanthanide cations, which
possess unique electronic and photophysical properties (19). The
f-block elements exhibit long-lived luminescence, which can be

Significance

Despite considerable advances in de novo protein design in
recent years, it still remains challenging to engineer proteins
with large internal cavities that can be functionalized to be-
come biotechnological tools, such as specific binders, sensors,
or catalysts. In this work, we outline a computational strategy
to combine multiple de novo designed domains into symmetric
protein assemblies that enclose large internal chambers. The
high stability of de novo scaffolds enables ready functionali-
zation of these chambers; for instance, with specific metal-
binding sites, as demonstrated here by generating a
lanthanide-binding protein with ultra-high affinity.

molecule, an approach that is exploited in so-called lanthanide-
binding tags (20, 21). De novo designed peptides were shown
previously to form lanthanide-binding coiled coils with potential
applications as paramagnetic MRI contrast agents (22, 23). Their
strong Lewis acidity also makes lanthanides powerful catalysts
for various synthetically useful reactions (24), although their

with ultra-high affinity, which provides a starting point for the
future engineering of
lanthanide-dependent biotechnological

Results
DeNovoTIM15. We combined stabilizing sequence changes (18)
with circular permutation and substitution of residues at the top
of the TIM barrel to produce stable and modular starting TIM
barrel scaffolds (Fig. 1A). These proteins, dubbed DeNovoTIMs,
were expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli. They are stable
beyond 95 °C as assessed by circular dichroism (CD) and have a
guanidinium chloride unfolding midpoint of ∼2M (Fig. 1B). One
of the variants, DeNovoTIM15, was crystallized and the struc-
ture solved using the Rosetta model as input for molecular re-
placement at a resolution of 2.3 Å (Table 1). The design model
and crystal structure were very similar, with an all-atom Cα

root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 1.65 Å (Fig. 1C).
Exploiting the symmetry of the de novo TIM system, we were
able to express a half fragment of DeNovoTIM15, containing
only the first two repeat units of the protein. This protein was
expressed in E. coli and purified. It was shown to be a homo-
dimer by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (SI Appendix,
Fig. S1), consistent with a C2-symmetric homodimeric assembly.
Relocating the termini from the top to the bottom of the barrel
by circular permutation provided positions at the top of the TIM
barrel where loops could be substituted with inserted domains.
We inserted domains in one of the loops that is structurally
equivalent to the prepermutation termini: the β-α loop con-
necting β3 and α3.

Symmetric Fusion Design. To create large, engineerable reaction
chambers at the top of the TIM barrel, we used a computational
approach that takes advantage of the C2 symmetry of many de
novo designed homodimers. C2-symmetric de novo designed homo-
dimer proteins were fused to the top of the half-DeNovoTIM15 using
a method that preserves symmetry of the resulting assembly. Two
different symmetric homodimers were considered for the top of
the reaction chamber: a de novo designed ferredoxin (FD) fold
(27) and cFr (28), derived from Top7 (29), a de novo designed
protein with a fold not previously seen in nature. Both of these
dimers have continuous β-sheets extending across the dimer in-
terface. The domain insertion function of RosettaRemodel (30)
was used to connect each “lid” monomer to a monomer of the

homodimeric TIM barrel. Linker loops between zero and six
residues in length were generated to connect the domains (Fig. 2A),
and C2 symmetry as well as distance constraints were imposed
during design to arrive at fusion proteins in which both the TIM
barrel dimer interface and lid dimer interface were intact. We
discarded all models for which complete chain closure was unsuc-
cessful and used Rosetta to assign the sequences of the linker loops.
Limited sequence changes were made at the interface between
domains to avoid generating structures with stability dependent on
these interactions. Changes to the insert (four per monomer) and
TIM (two per monomer) domains were solely made to reduce the
charge lining the chamber between domains (SI Appendix, Fig. S2).
Following successful construction of the fused homodimer, we also
considered additional features that could provide function to the
otherwise inert scaffold. Visual inspection of the top of the TIM
barrel suggested that the introduction of C4-symmetric polar resi-
dues could generate a C4-symmetric metal ion-binding site. To
explore this, we created fusion protein variants in which glutamate
or histidine residues replaced select valines at the top of one of the
β-strands, at positions 31 and 154 of the full-length construct. In
each case, there were four altered residues, corresponding to the C4
symmetry of the TIM barrel.

Characterization of TFD Designs. The most successful fusion con-
tained a C2-symmetric FD atop DeNovoTIM15, with three-
residue glycine linkers closing both junctions. This protein,

dubbed TIM-FD dimer (TFD) is remarkably stable, soluble, and
robust. Two variants of this scaffold were characterized. The
first, TFD-HE, contains a histidine in position 31 and a gluta-
mate in position 154, while the second, TFD-EE, contains two
glutamate substitutions in these positions at the top of the beta-
barrel, for a total of four potentially metal-coordinating residues
in the two-fold symmetric assembly. Both TFD-HE and TFD-EE
are remarkably stable protein scaffolds (Fig. 3A). They were
subjected to the same CD experiments as the lid-less TIM barrel
variant detailed in Fig. 1B, and we observed an even greater
resilience to thermal denaturation, as 80% of the secondary
structure remained intact at 95 °C. Furthermore, the scaffolds
showed a two-step melting behavior in response to chemical
denaturation with guanidinium chloride (GdnHCl), reflecting
the unfolding of the TIM domain (2.5, 2.1 M GdnHCl) and the
FD insert domain (7.0, 6.9 M GdnHCl), respectively. The TFD
scaffolds also remain fully folded in substantial amounts of
cosolvent, such as 50% acetonitrile (SI Appendix, Fig. S3).

The proteins were first crystallized in the absence of metal.
The structure of TFD-HE was determined at 1.4 Å. This protein
construct contained an N-terminal affinity tag that remained in
the protein that was crystallized. The tag was well resolved in the
electron density, partially packing beside the C-terminal helix,
which explained our difficulty in cleaving it with tobacco etch
virus (TEV) protease. This structure validated the connectivity
and topology of the TIM barrel and FD domains. However,

Fig. 2. Construction of the TFD scaffolds. (A) The insert domain (yellow) was inserted into a loop of the TIM barrel (green) using RosettaRemodel. Select sites
were mutated to reduce the surface charge of the inserted domains (gray spheres). Using constraints between the inserted domain and its symmetric partner,
the symmetry of the assembly was maintained, yielding a C2-symmetric homodimer following successful construction. (B) In the dimeric assembly, the two C2-
symmetric domains have aligned symmetry axes, with contiguous beta-sheets. Linking peptides are shown in teal. (C) The successfully built homodimeric
Rosetta model.

there was a rotation of the two domains relative to each other,
deviating by 10° around the symmetry axis when compared to the
design model (Fig. 3 B–E). The TIM domain and FD domain
enclose an internal cavity of 420 Å3. The inserted H31 and E154
residues of this protein did not adopt a conformation that would
support metal binding as the histidines in the H-E-H-E sym-
metric site are constrained to hydrogen-bond networks.

The structure of the second variant, TFD-EE, was determined
at 2.5 Å resolution and contains three dimers in the asymmetric
unit. The rotation of the two domains relative to each other was
more pronounced, deviating by 17 to 34°. Despite this, the TIM
and FD dimers align to their parental domains with Cα rmsds of
3.16 Å and 1.78 Å, respectively, with deviations in the TIM do-
main predominantly explained by shifts of the C-terminal helix,
remote from the domain-domain interface. In the central sym-
metric metal-binding site, we observed electron density consis-
tent with a bound metal ion, even though no specific metal was
added to the protein sample (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). We believe
this metal copurified with the protein from the intracellular
environment or lysate. The coordination sphere resembles the
situation in natural calcium-binding proteins, which led us to
hypothesize that the bound metal is likely a Ca2+ ion. Microwave
inductively coupled atmospheric pressure plasma mass spec-
trometry (MICAP-MS) experiments supported this hypothesis
(SI Appendix, Tables S1 and S2), so a Ca2+ ion was modeled into
the crystal structure at the center of each dimer.

Lanthanide Binding. We hypothesized that the four glutamate
residues at the center of TFD-EE would provide a suitable co-
ordination environment for large trivalent cations, such as lan-
thanides, as these are typically oxophilic and can interact directly
with eight or more ligand atoms. Inspired by the design of
lanthanide-binding tags (21), we installed an intrinsic antenna
residue adjacent to the metal-binding site (N6W mutation); this
tryptophan serves as a site-specific sensitizer for lanthanide lu-
minescence (Fig. 4 A–C). When the protein was mixed with
TbCl3, strong tryptophan-enhanced terbium(III) luminescence
was observed upon excitation at 280 nm, enabling quantitative

measurement of lanthanide binding through a specific spectro-
scopic readout. Furthermore, we determined the crystal struc-
ture of terbium(III)-bound TFD-EE N6W at 1.85 Å resolution
and observed strong anomalous electron density at the metal-
binding site originating from specific binding of the heavy ion
(Fig. 4B). The C2 symmetry of the scaffold is lost in this structure
due to a translation of the FD dimer with respect to the TIM
barrel, further indicating the flexibility of the linkers that connect
both domains.

We titrated metal-free protein with preincubated mixtures of
TbCl3 and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and moni-
tored the enhanced terbium signal over time (Fig. 4D). The
protein slowly removes the metal from the EDTA complex,
which has a binding constant of 1.6 × 10−18 M (31), suggesting
ultra-high affinity. A binding curve based on the estimated free
metal concentration in these mixtures indicates a binding affinity
of TFD-EE for Tb(III) in the subfemtomolar range. Notably,
when the Tb(III)/protein complex is formed first, even 100-fold
excess EDTA does not quantitatively remove the metal from the
scaffold after 1 wk of incubation. Displacement experiments with
other lanthanides showed that Tb(III) bound to TFD-EE N6W
can be exchanged on the timescale of hours. Eu(III) and Yb(III)
bind with comparable affinity, while Ce(III) binds ∼10-fold
weaker (SI Appendix, Fig. S5).

Discussion
By fusing two de novo designed homodimeric proteins such that
their C2 symmetry axes are preserved, we have created a
homodimeric protein with a TIM barrel base and a dimeric FD
lid surrounding an enclosed chamber. Fusion of de novo
designed building blocks has been used previously to create
proteins with extended beta sheets (32). We show here that ex-
tended enclosed cavities can be created by designed juxtoposi-
tion of de novo C2 building blocks. Some examples of similar
fusions creating cavities exist in nature, such as AAA+-type
molecular machines (33) or ATP-binding cassette (ABC) mem-
brane transporters (34). However, to our knowledge, TFD is the
most compact protein to enclose a central cavity in this manner.

Our TIM-FD design has attractive features as a scaffold for
future de novo enzyme design. First, a large chamber is formed
at the interface between two structured domains (Fig. 3 F and
G). In TFD, there are 9 × 2 residues pointing into this chamber
from the TIM barrel, and 9 × 2 from the FD, for a total of 36

functionalizable residues. Some of
these residues could be
substituted with hydrophobic amino acids to increase the hy-
drophobic character of the chamber. Second, the high stability of
TFD suggests it should tolerate considerable modification of
the residues surrounding the chamber. TFD and the derivative

was equipped with an intrinsic tryptophan antenna (N6W, pink) to enhance Tb(III) luminescence through energy transfer. The initial C2 symmetry of the
dimeric scaffold is lost, as the FD lid domain is both rotated and translated compared to the structures shown above. Each monomer exhibits a distinct
conformation of the flexible linkers that connect both domains. (B) Close-up view of the metal-binding site, which consists of 2 × 2 glutamate residues (green
and gray). 2Fo-Fc electron density is shown as a blue mesh contoured at 1.0 σ. Anomalous electron density is shown as a red mesh at 15.0 σ, indicating specific
binding of the lanthanide ion. The antenna tryptophan (pink) is in close proximity (<5.0 Å), allowing for efficient energy transfer. The distance between Tb(III)
and the coordinating carboxylate oxygen atoms is 2.3 to 2.5 Å and the distance between Tb(III) and the axial water molecule is 2.7 Å. (C) Tryptophan-

TbCl3 allows for the estimation of the Tb(III)-binding affinity of the protein scaffold in the subfemtomolar range, based on KD(Tb3+/EDTA) = 1.6 × 10−18 M as
the reference.

designs presented here are homodimeric proteins, but
the
modular design makes it readily convertible to an asymmetric
monomeric protein through the simple closure of the protein
chain between two repeats (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). Control of the
interdomain configuration of the TIM domain and FD remains a
challenge. While the homodimeric domains were both internally
unaffected by fusion into a two-domain homodimeric assembly,
their relative orientations were not exactly as predicted. Con-
trolling this relative position will be important for construction of
binding sites that use elements from both domains. Future design
will address the relative orientations through engineering of the
contacting surfaces and linking loops. It should also be noted
that this mobility, if controlled, could prove beneficial in the
longer term as dynamics are often important to enzyme function.
In this work, the TIM barrel component of the highly stable
TFD scaffold was equipped with a specific binding site for lan-
thanide ions. As lanthanides find applications in various tech-
nologies, including magnets, lasers, luminescent materials, and

optoelectronics, there is an increasing demand in industry (35).
However, conventional mining of these elements is problematic,
and other sources of low lanthanide concentration must be
considered. A biomacromolecular extraction concept has re-
cently been suggested using lanmodulin, a natural lanthanide-
binding protein (36). Our de novo lanthanide-binding scaffold,
TFD-EE, exhibits even higher lanthanide affinity and tolerates
heat and cosolvents to a remarkable extent. It may thus be uti-
lized in biotechnological approaches to lanthanide recycling as
well as lanthanide-dependent catalysis. While the FD lid domain
of TFD-EE is not involved in metal binding, it will be crucial for
further engineering; for example, providing residues for specific
substrate recognition inside the cavity. We are currently pursuing
the design of enzyme active sites in the lanthanide-bound TFD
scaffolds—for both hydrolytic and carbon-carbon bond forming
reactions that can capitalize on the strong Lewis acidity of lan-
thanide ions. Our approach can be extended to various other
metals by changing the type and geometry of the coordinating

residues. Large cofactors may also be inserted through specific
interactions with the TIM domain or FD domain. We believe the
internal chamber-containing scaffolds will provide a modular
platform for de novo enzyme engineering, contributing to the
longstanding goal of designing novel enzymes from scratch.

Methods
Protein Engineering and Fusion Protein Design. DeNovoTIM15 was developed
combining stabilizing changes introduced to de novo TIM barrel sTIM11 by
Romero-Romero, et al. (18), with select mutations at the top of the TIM
barrel and a circular permutation (Fig. 1A). DeNovoTIM15 corresponds to the
sequence of DeNovoTIM13 with a change of eight residues replacing
charged residues atop the TIM barrel. A C2-symmetric half-TIM construct was
created by truncating the four-repeat protein to two repeats. This construct
was cloned and expressed and found to self-assemble into a homodimer as
measured by size-exclusion chromatography (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Roset-
taRemodel was used to design the connections (or “linkers”) between half-
DeNovoTIM15 and each inserted domain (Fig. 2). We used the design feature
that facilitates the introduction of a domain as a rigid body insertion while
allowing the connecting loops to be designed. The inserted domain has both
its termini connected within a loop of a hosting structure; RosettaRemodel
uses random fragments to sample the linkers and loop closure criteria to
screen plausible fusions of the inserted domain and the host structure. By
sampling the linker conformations, the relative position of the inserted
domain with respect to the host structure is also sampled (Fig. 2A). Linker
lengths between zero and six amino acids were tested, though only a subset
produced fully connected fusion proteins. For this project, we enabled
symmetry with the domain insertion feature in RosettaRemodel, with the C2
symmetry of the host structure (TIM barrel) held constant while the rigid-
body conformations of the FD or cFr domains move synchronously across the
interface during sampling. To ensure that the dimer interfaces of the
inserted domains are maintained, restraints corresponding to the FD and cFr
dimers were used, defined as distance constraints harvested from atom-pairs
from the dimer structures. The RosettaRemodel flags and the calculation
setups as blueprint files are given in the SI Appendix.

Gene Synthesis, Protein Expression, and Purification. Genes were synthesized
by commercial vendors and cloned into vectors for protein expression in
E. coli. Protein was expressed in shaking liquid cultures using either isopropyl
thiogalactoside or autoinduction methods. Cells were lysed using high-
pressure homogenization or sonication and clarified by centrifugation.
This lysate was purified by gravity-flow nickel-affinity chromatography and
further purified using either size-exclusion chromatography or TEV protease
digestion, followed by a secondary nickel separation step. As these proteins
have shown themselves to be extremely robust, we do not believe alter-
ations in the expression and purification protocols to be substantive to the
results. For more detailed information for specific protein constructs see SI
Appendix, Methods.

Thermal and Chemical Protein Denaturation Measured by CD Spectroscopy. CD
experiments were performed in quartz cuvettes with 2 mm path length using
a JASCO J-710 CD instrument. The proteins were diluted in pure water or 0.5
to 8.0 M guanidinium chloride solution to a final concentration of 20 μM TFD
monomer, with a 30 min incubation time at room temperature prior to
measurement. Thermal denaturation curves were measured in the absence
of denaturing agent at 222 nm from 25 to 95 °C with a scan speed of 30 K/h.
Chemical denaturation curves were generated by measuring CD spectra (260
to 200 nm, averaging five scans) at various concentrations of guanidinium
chloride at 25 °C. The signal at 222 nm was converted into mean residue
molar ellipticity, and then to fraction of total protein unfolded. All points
were measured in triplicates. The curves were fit with a sigmoidal equation
to determine the transition points.

Protein stability in cosolvents was measured by recording CD spectra (260
to 200 nm, five averages) of TFD-EE (c = 20 μM monomer) after incubation in
0 to 90% methanol or acetonitrile for 20 min at 25 °C.

Crystallization and Structure Determination. All proteins were crystallized by
vapor diffusion. The reengineered DeNovoTIM15 was crystallized in Mor-
pheus screen solution D9 (37): 10% wt/vol polyethylene glycol (PEG) 20000,
20% vol/vol PEG monomethyl ether 550 0.02 M each of each 1,6-hexanediol,
1-butanol, (RS)-1,2-propanediol, 2-propanol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,3-propane-
diol, 0.1 M bicine/Trizma base pH 8.5. TFD-HE was crystallized in 0.1 M citric
acid pH 4.0 and 2.4 M ammonium sulfate. Small rod-shaped crystals were
found after 6 mo of incubation. Crystals of TFD-EE were grown in a sitting

drop vapor diffusion setup in 96-well plates at 20 °C. The protein solution
(10 mg/mL in 25 mM Hepes pH 7.5) was mixed 1:1 with the reservoir solution,
which contained 0.1 M Hepes pH 7.5, 10 to 15% PEG 4000, and 5 to 10%
isopropanol using microseeding (38). Rod-shaped crystals grew within 7 d.
TFD-EE N6W was mixed 1:1 with TbCl3 and concentrated to 8 mg/mL. Crystals
grew in 0.1 M Hepes pH 7.5, 20% PEG 4000, and 10% isopropanol, con-
taining Gly3 as an additive. The cryo-protectant solutions for all TFD-EE
crystals consisted of the reservoir solution supplemented with 20% ethylene
glycol. Crystals were cryo-cooled in liquid nitrogen.

Diffraction data from DeNovoTIM15 and TFD-HE were collected at the
Advanced Light Source (ALS) Beamline 8.2.1. TFD-EE data were collected at
the synchrotron beamline X06SA (PXI) and Tb(III)-bound TFD-EE N6W at
X06DA (PXIII) at the Swiss Light Source. In all cases, diffraction was collected
at 1.0 Å with the crystals kept at 100 K. The program XDS was used for initial
data processing (39).

All structures were refined and built using the Phenix and CCP4 software
suites (40, 41), using the program PHASER (42) to phase the structures by
molecular replacement. DeNovoTIM15 was phased using the unaltered
Rosetta design model. TFD-EE and TFD-HE structures were phased by
searching separately for the TIM domain and FD domain. In the case of the
third TFD-EE dimer and TFD-HE structure, the FD dimer could not be placed
by phaser, but was manually built by modeling helices into Fo-Fc difference
density and iterative manual model building. Further model building and
refinement were done in iterative cycles using the programs Coot (43) and
phenix.refine (40) or Refmac (44), including translation–libration–screw re-
finement (45) and reference model restraints to the Rosetta models. The
model quality was validated using MolProbity (46). Structure illustrations
were prepared with PyMOL (47), while estimates of volume of enclosed
cavity were obtained using the CASTp server (48), based upon models with
bulk solvent-accessible channels plugged with dummy atoms. Structures
were deposited to the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession numbers
6WVS, 6WXP, 6WXO, and 6ZV9. Summary statistics are presented in Table 1.

ICP-MS Measurements. Element screening and Ca quantification was carried
out using MICAP-MS systems. The instruments are prototype instruments
developed in the Laboratory for Inorganic Chemistry at ETH Zürich special-
ized for measuring metal ions (49). A TFD-EE sample was buffer-exchanged
with 1 mM Hepes pH 7.5 using a PD10 desalting column. The same buffer
was used as the reference sample. First, a MICAP-MS element screen was
performed at 45 μM TIM-EE monomer to generate semiquantitative esti-
mates of element concentrations. Subsequently, the amount of calcium in
the sample was determined quantitatively using a MICAP-MS experiment,
using an external calibration between 0 and 500 μg/L Ca, with Sc as an in-
ternal
standard. Further experimental details are described in the
SI Appendix.

Lanthanide-Binding Measurements. Tryptophan-enhanced terbium lumines-
cence was measured in 96-well plates using a Varioskan Flash plate reader in
time-resolved fluorescence mode (TRF, delay time: 50 μs, integration time: 1
ms). This mode allows for suppression of all background signals, collecting
only the long-lived terbium luminescence in a pulsed experiment. All ex-
periments were performed in 25 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and
treated with Chelex100 resin. TFD variants were also dialyzed in the pres-
ence of Chelex100 resin prior to measurement to remove residual bound
metals. TFD-QQ N6W served as a negative control (metal-binding site knock-
out, E to Q mutations). Emission spectra (450 to 650 nm) were collected upon
excitation of the tryptophan antenna at 280 nm, after 3 h incubation of
10 μM TFD dimer and 20 μM TbCl3. Time courses were collected with the
same plate reader setup monitoring the Tb(III) luminescence peak (λex = 280
nm, λem = 545 nm) over time. Titrations were performed with 10 μM TFD-EE
N6W and various preincubated mixtures of EDTA and TbCl3. The titration
curve was derived from spectra recorded after 24 h incubation, estimating
the concentration of free Tb(III) based on the KD(Tb/EDTA) = 1.6 × 10−18 M as
a reference (31). Binding of other lanthanide ions was measured in dis-
placement titrations of 5 μM preincubated Tb(III)/TFD-EE N6W complex with
increasing amounts of CeCl3, EuCl3 or YbCl3.

Data Availability. The crystal structures data of DeNovoTIM15, TFD-HE, TFD-
EE, and Tb(III)-bound TFD-EE N6W have been deposited in the PDB with
accession codes 6WVS, 6WXP, 6WXO, and 6ZV9.
