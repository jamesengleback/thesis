ABSTRACT
Various invivomutagenesis methods have been de-
veloped to facilitate fast and efﬁcient continuous
evolution of proteins in cells. However, they either
modify the DNA region that does not match the tar-
get gene, or suffer from low mutation rates. Here,
we report a mutator, eMutaT7 (enhanced MutaT7),
with very fast in vivo mutation rate and high gene-
speciﬁcity in Escherichia coli. eMutaT7, a cytidine
deaminase fused to an orthogonal RNA polymerase,
can introduce up to ∼4 mutations per 1 kb per day,
rivalling the rate in typical invitromutagenesis for di-
rected evolution of proteins, and promotes rapid con-
tinuous evolution of model proteins for antibiotic re-
sistance and allosteric activation. eMutaT7 provides
a very simple and tunable method for continuous di-
rected evolution of proteins, and suggests that the
fusion of new DNA-modifying enzymes to the orthog-
onal RNA polymerase is a promising strategy to ex-
plore the expanded sequence space without compro-
mising gene speciﬁcity.

GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT

INTRODUCTION
Directed evolution is a powerful tool for studying protein
evolution and obtaining new functional biomolecules for
research, biotechnology, and medicine (1). Traditional di-
rected evolution methods usually rely on in vitro diversifi-
cation of a target gene, followed by selection or screen of
variants exhibiting better function. Despite their broad ap-
plication, these methods consist of labour-intensive discrete
steps and generate limited sequence diversity due to rela-
tively low efficiency of cellular DNA uptake. To explore the
expanded sequence space with minimal manual labour, var-
ious in vivo mutagenesis methods have been recently devel-
oped and enable continuous directed evolution (CDE), in
which gene diversification and selection are simultaneously
performed inside of cells (2).

The ideal in vivo mutagenesis method for CDE of pro-
teins should have high gene specificity to reduce off-target
mutagenesis and should make evenly distributed mutations
within targets to explore wider sequence space. In most
methods, however, the target region is not well correlated
with the specific gene region (2). For example, several Cas9-
based methods such as base editor (3), CRISPR-X (4), and
EvolvR (5), target 3–350 nucleotides from gRNA-binding
sites without distinguishing gene boundary. Methods us-
ing an orthogonal error-prone DNA polymerase target the
whole or part of a plasmid with neither gene specificity
nor temporal control of mutagenesis (6,7). A virus-based
method, PACE (8), is a pioneering example of CDE of a
target gene with many successful examples of protein evo-
lution (2), and has recently been extended to mammalian
cells (9,10). However, PACE is inherently based on random
mutagenesis without positional specificity and requires spe-
cialized equipment for continuous supply of fresh host cells
(8). The truly gene-specific in vivo mutagenesis was reported
in systems using a fusion protein of a cytidine deaminase
and T7 RNA polymerase (T7RNAP), MutaT7 in bacteria
(11) and TRACE in human cells (12). T7RNAP allows spe-
cific targeting to T7 promoter-controlled genes, upon which
a cytidine deaminase introduces the C→T and G→A mu-
tations on the target and non-target strands, respectively.
Despite the high gene-specificity, they showed low mutation
rates (e.g. MutaT7, 0.34 mutations day−1 kb−1; TRACE,

0.1–0.8 mutations day−1 kb−1), undermining its advantage
over the typical in vitro mutagenesis-based methods.

We reasoned that the method using an orthogonal RNA
polymerase could be an ideal solution for gene-specific in
vivo mutagenesis, and could substantially boost its potential
by accelerating the mutation rate. We also thought that the
fast doubling time could make bacteria a better host to ex-
plore the higher clonal diversity. Here, we report a new gene-
specific in vivo mutagenesis system that has significantly
higher mutation rate in E. coli. Our results also demon-
strate that the systematic search for new DNA-modifying
enzymes for fusion to an orthogonal RNA polymerase may
greatly broaden the sequence space to explore for directed
evolution of proteins.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmid cloning and materials
Escherichia coli strains, plasmids, and primers used in
this study are listed in Supplementary Tables S1–S3,
respectively. The mutator plasmids expressing eMutaT7
(pHyo094) and MutaT7 (pHyo099) were obtained as fol-
lows: the deaminase gene that expresses Petromyzon mar-
inus cytidine deaminase (PmCDA1) and rat apolipopro-
tein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like (rApobec1)
were amplified from AIDv2 (Addgene #79620) and pCMV-
BE3 (Addgene #73021), respectively (3,13). T7 RNA poly-
merase gene, in which NdeI site was deleted using in-
verse PCR (14), was amplified from pNL001 (15). Two
DNA fragments were linked by overlapping PCR with a
linker gene for the 16-amino acid XTEN linker (3) between
two genes. The fused DNA expressing PmCDA1-XTEN-
T7RNAP was inserted into pSK633 (16) between the NdeI
and PstI sites. The XTEN linker of pHyo099 was exchanged
into the linker of MutaT7 (pHyo287) and the araBAD pro-
moter of pHyo287 was exchanged into the A1lacO pro-
moter (pHyo288) by inverse PCR.

All target plasmids (pHyo182, pheS A294G; pHyo245,
pheS A294G with the dual promoter system; pHyo249,
degP A184S with the dual promoter system; pHyo253,
TEM-1 with the dual promoter system) were constructed
in a low copy-number plasmid (one or two copy per a
single cell; the parent plasmid is pNL001 (15)). To make
pheS A294G gene transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase
(pHyo175, pET28b-pheS A294G), pheS A294G gene was
amplified from the SK324 strain (17) and inserted into
pET28b vector using NdeI and XhoI sites. DNA fragment
from lacI to pheS A294G gene containing T7-lac promoter
and T7 terminator (lacI-T7-lac promoter-pheS A294G-T7
terminator) was amplified from pHyo175, and inserted in
the pNL001 vector between BamHI and EcoRI sites to
make pHyo182 (pVS133-pheS A294G). To make dual pro-
moter system (pHyo245), a new T7-lac promoter and T7
terminator sequences were inserted in front of T7 termina-
tor and between T7 promoter and lacI gene region, respec-
tively, in the reverse direction.

For degP evolution experiments, pheS A294G was re-
placed with degP A184S amplified from pSK735 (16) and
wild-type degP amplified from p7 (18) to make pHyo249
(degP A294G) and pHyo246 (degP), respectively, using

NEBuilder Hifi DNA assembly master Mix (New England
Biolabs, USA).

For TEM-1 evolution experiments, ampicillin resistance
gene in the target plasmid was replaced with tetracy-
cline resistance gene amplified from pREMCM3 (19) and
TEM-1 gene was replaced with pheS A294G gene to make
pHyo253, using NEBuilder Hifi DNA assembly master
Mix.

All plasmids harboring variants of the mutator or tar-
gets (mutation, deletion, and insertion) were constructed
using inverse PCR. eMutaT7 variants (low processive vari-
ants or linker length variants) were made on pHyo094. The
degP variants were made on pHyo246 and pHyo249 to
make pHyo254 (degP P231L) and pHyo255 (degP A184S,
P231L), respectively, for in vivo viability assay, and on p7
and pSK735 to make pHyo256 (degP P231L) and pHyo257
(degP A184S P231L), respectively, for in vitro enzymatic
assay.

All PCR experiments were conducted with KOD Plus
neo DNA polymerase (Toyobo, Japan). Restriction en-
zymes, T4 polynucleotide kinase and T4 DNA ligases were
purchased from Enzynomics (South Korea). Plasmids and
DNA fragments were prepped with LaboPass™ plasmid
DNA purification kit mini, LaboPass™ PCR purification
kit, and LaboPass™ Gel extraction kit (Cosmogenetech,
South Korea). Sequences of genes in plasmids constructed
in this study were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Macro-
gen, South Korea). Antibiotics (ampicillin, chlorampheni-
col, kanamycin, and tetracycline), arabinose, and IPTG
were purchased from LPS solution (South Korea). Cefo-
taxime and ceftazidime were purchased from Tokyo chem-
ical industry (Japan). H-p-Chloro-DL-Phe-OH (p-Cl-Phe)
was purchased from Bachem (Switzerland).

E. coli strain construction
All the strains in this study were constructed by ␭-Red-
mediated recombineering with the pSIM6 plasmid (20). To
construct the ung strain (cHYO057), kanamycin resis-
tance gene region including 100-bp upstream and 100-bp
downstream was amplified with primers 180 and 181, and
the open reading frame (ORF) of wild-type ung in W3110
was replaced by the kanamycin resistance gene. To con-
struct the degP ung strain (cHYO059), SK345 (degP)
(17) was used as a recipient cell. Proper gene deletion or
insertion were confirmed by colony PCR using 2X TOP
Simple™ DyeMIX-Tenuto (Enzynomics), and 30 ␮g/ml of
kanamycin was used for selection.

Western blot
Cells expressing N-terminal FLAG-tagged pheS A924G
were grown to OD600 ∼0.6 in LB at 37◦C. 30-␮l samples of
the cultures were mixed with 4× SDS sample buffer, heated
at 95◦C for 15 min, and centrifuged at 13 000 × g for 10 min.
Samples (7 ␮l) were separated by SDS/PAGE and trans-
ferred to PVDF membrane (ATTO, Japan). The membrane
was sequentially incubated in Ezblock protein-free Block-
ing buffer (ATTO), anti-OctA (FLAG octapeptide) anti-
body (2000:1 dilution; SantaCruz, USA), and anti-rabbit
IgG-HRP (2000:1 dilution; SantaCruz), and then blotted

with the WestSaveUp ECL solution (AbFrontier, South Ko-
rea). Image was obtained using Amersham imager 600 (GE
Healthcare, USA).

Mutation cycle
The ung cells (cHYO057) harboring a mutator plas-
mid (pHyo094) and a target plasmid (pHyo182 for sin-
gle promoter and pHyo245 for dual promoter) were grown
overnight in LB broth supplemented with 100 ␮g/ml
ampicillin and 35 ␮g/ml chloramphenicol (cycle #0). The
overnight cultures (3.5 ␮l) were mixed with 350 ␮l of LB
broth supplemented with 100 ␮g/ml ampicillin, 35 ␮g/ml
chloramphenicol, 0.2% arabinose and 0.1 mM IPTG in a
96-deep well plate (Bioneer, South Korea) and incubated at
37◦C for 4 h (cycle #1). The dilution–incubation cycle was
repeated up to 27 times. At the end of each cycle, a fraction
of cells were stored at −80◦C as 15% glycerol stocks.

To determine the number of accumulated mutations on
the pheS A294G gene, cells at the selected mutagenesis cy-
cles (cycle #3, #6, #9, #18 and #27) were streaked on LB-
Agar plate containing 100 ␮g/ml ampicillin. Five colonies
were randomly chosen for plasmid isolation and the se-
quence determination. Mutations were counted in the re-
gion from 80-bp upstream to 35-bp downstream of the
pheS gene (total 1099 bp). Primers 507 and 529 was used
for sequencing of target plasmids that have dual promoter
system, and universal sequencing primers were used for
sequencing of plasmids that have single promoter system
(primers T7 promoter and T7 terminator in Supplementary
Table S3).

PheS A294G suppression assay
Samples obtained at the endpoint of each cycle (overnight
culture for cycle #0) were diluted to OD600 ∼0.2. Serial
10-fold dilutions of cells (5␮l) were spotted on YEG-agar
plates and grown on either selective (1.6 mM p-Cl-Phe, 0.2%
arabinose and 0.1 mM IPTG) or nonselective (no additives)
YEG-agar plates at 37◦C overnight. Viable cells on each
condition were counted and the suppressor frequency was
calculated as N1/N0 (N1: colony forming unit (CFU) in se-
lective plates and N0: CFU in nonselective plates).

Viability assay
Overnight cultures expressing eMutaT7, unfused PmCDA1
and T7RNAP, no mutator, or MP6, were diluted 100-fold in
LB broth supplemented with 35 ␮g/mL chloramphenicol,
grown to a log phase (OD600 = 0.2–0.5) at 37◦C, and diluted
to OD600 ∼0.2. Serial 10-fold dilutions of cells (5 ␮l) were
spotted on LB-agar plates supplemented with 0.2% arabi-
nose and 35 ␮g/ml chloramphenicol and grown at 37◦C for
16 h. Viable cells were counted to calculate CFU/ml (Figure
2E and Supplementary Figure S4).

To determine the rifampicin resistance, samples after cy-
cle #0 and #27 were grown to log phase in LB broth supple-
mented with 100 ␮g/ml ampicillin and 35 ␮g/ml chloram-
phenicol, and subjected to viability assay on selective (80
␮g/ml rifampicin) or nonselective (no rifampicin) plates.

High-throughput sequencing and data analysis
Cells taken at cycle 27 were grown in 15 ml of LB broth
without arabinose and IPTG, and the target plasmids were
extracted with Plasmid Miniprep Kit. The 3289-bp DNA
fragments containing the pheS A924G gene were amplified
using primers 512 and 513 covering a region ranging from
1016 bp upstream from T7 promoter to 1069 bp down-
stream including T7 terminator. Samples were then pre-
pared with TruSeq Nano DNA Kit and sequenced on Il-
lumina HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, USA; operated by Macro-
gen) in 2 × 101 paired-end runs using the manufacturer’s
reagents following the manufacturer’s protocol to deter-
mine the mutation pattern occurred on target plasmids.

target sequence using Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool
(BWA) v0.7.17 with mem mode and BAM files generated
by mapping were sorted using SAMtools v.1.6 (22,23).
Sorted bam files were subject to perform mpileup using
SAMtools mpileup with maximum depth option, which
was set as total number of trimmed reads, and output
tag list option consisting of DP, DP4 and AD. BCFtools
v1.6, which was a set of utilities of SAMtools package, was
used to call allele for each locus with multiallelic-caller
option. Allele count for each allele and ratio (each allele
count/total allele count) were calculated based on AD
information of VCF files.

Mutation rate calculation
Mutation rate caused by eMutaT7 was calculated and pre-
sented as two styles: (i) mutations per base per generation
or (ii) mutations per day per 1 kb. Mutations were counted
in the 1099-bp region of pheS for Sanger Sequencing. The
number of generations per one cycle was calculated as 6.6
(log2100) because cell density increases 100-fold during one
cycle (4 h). To present in the first style, the number of mu-
tations was averaged for chosen clones and divided by the
number of nucleotides (1099) and generations (6.6 × cy-
cle number). To present in the second style, the number of
mutations was averaged and divided by incubation days (6
cycles·day−1) and the length of the gene region (1.099 kb).
To compare the values with those of MutaT7, the num-
ber of mutations were counted from Supplementary Figure
S10 of the Shoulders group’s report (11). Mutation rates of
TRACE were estimated from Figure 2A and Supplemen-
tary Figure S3b of the Chen group’s report (12).

Statistical analysis of high-throughput sequencing data
For high-throughput sequencing data (Figure 3), Mann–
Whitney test (unpaired Wilcoxon test) was used to assess
the significance of the mutation frequency caused by eMu-
taT7 system. Calculation was conducted using Stata (USA).
Statistically significance were determined with P values de-
fined as *P < 0.05, **P < 0.0001 for this experiment. For

e32 Nucleic Acids Research, 2021, Vol. 49, No. 6

other data, we assumed the data will follow normal distri-
bution and performed Student’s t-test.

Antibiotic resistance gene evolution
For TEM-1 and AmpC evolution, all the experiments were
performed with LB supplemented with 6 ␮g/ml tetra-
cycline, 35 ␮g/ml chloramphenicol, 0.2% arabinose and
0.1mM IPTG. We tested multiple antibiotic concentrations
at the same time, of which the cells grown at the highest
concentration were subjected to the next round of growth
in fresh media with equal or higher amounts of antibi-
otics. The concentration of each antibiotic (cefotaxime, cef-
tazidime, or carbenicillin) was gradually increased as indi-
cated in Figure 5A, Supplementary Figure S10. All the ex-
periments were conducted in triplicate and if two out of
three samples did not grow, one sample that was grown
was inoculated into three samples for the next cycle. Af-
ter the evolution, plasmids were extracted in bulk from
evolution mixture grown in LB media supplemented only
with 6 ␮g/ml tetracycline and inserted into fresh ung cells
(cHYO057) harboring the T7 RNA polymerase-expressing
plasmid (pHyo183). Ten colonies were chosen to deter-
mine MICs, and plasmids from the five colonies with high
MIC values (400–800 ␮g/ml for CTX, 2000–4000 ␮g/ml for
CAZ and CB) were analyzed by Sanger sequencing. At the
end of each cycle, cells were stored at −80◦C as 15% glycerol
stocks.

MIC determination
Each strain was grown overnight without selection pressure,
inoculated at 1/10 000 dilution into fresh LB broth with
increasing concentrations of antibiotics in 96-well culture
plates (SPL, South Korea), and grown at 37◦C with shak-
ing (150 rpm) overnight with aluminum foil cover to prevent
too much evaporation. Cell density (OD600) was measured
with M200 microplate reader (TECAN, Switzerland).

DegP A184S evolution
For degP evolution, all the experiments were performed
with LB supplemented with 100 ␮g/ml ampicillin, 35
␮g/ml chloramphenicol, 0.2% arabinose and 0.1 mM
IPTG. At the end of each cycle, cells were stored at −80◦C
as 15% glycerol stock. We grew degP cells carrying
pHyo249 (DegP A184S-expressing plasmid) and pHyo094
(eMutaT7-expressing plasmid) at 37◦C. The growth temper-
ature increased by 1◦C every 4-hr cycle and no cell death
was detected while increasing to 44◦C (Figure 6A). After the
evolution was over, the plasmids were extracted and retrans-
formed into a fresh cells (cHYO059). Ten colonies were cho-
sen and the cell viability was tested on LB-Agar plates at
44◦C, where originally degP A184S could not grow. Plas-
mids from five colonies grown at 44◦C were analyzed by
Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Figure S11).

The degP P231L and degP A184S P231L variants were
freshly constructed (pHyo254 and 255 for cell viability test
and pHyo256 and 257 for in vitro enzymatic assay) to re-
move possible mutations that could have occurred in other
regions of the evolved plasmid.

Figure 1. Schematic illustration of the eMutaT7 system. The mutator and
the target gene are induced with 0.2% arabinose and 0.1 mM IPTG, respec-
tively. T7 RNA polymerase in the mutator transcribes the target gene be-
tween T7 promoter and T7 terminator and, during transcription, exposes
a short region of the coding strand as single strand DNA. The cytidine
deaminase in the mutator may convert cytosine to thymine mainly on the
exposed coding strand.

To test viability of the degP cells (cHYO059) expressing
degP A184S variants, cells were grown on selective (44◦C)
and nonselective (37◦C) LB-agar plates for 16 h.

DegP protein preparation and in vitro enzyme activity assay
DegP and its variants (P231L, A184S, P231L/A184S) were
expressed and purified as previously described (18). In vitro
enzymatic assays were performed as previously described
(18,24). In vitro enzymatic assays were performed at 37◦C in
50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8) and 100 mM NaCl. Basal
activities of DegP variants (10 ␮M) were monitored by in-
crease of fluorescence after cleavage of the reporter peptide
(100 ␮M; excitation, 320 nm; emission, 430 nm) using Infi-
nite F200Pro microplate reader (TECAN).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Design of the gene-specific in vivo mutagenesis system
Previously, Petromyzon marinus cytidine deaminase (Pm-
CDA1) was reported to be the most efficient deaminase in E.
coli (25) and was successfully used for genome editing (13).
Therefore, instead of rAPOBEC1 in MutaT7, we fused Pm-
CDA1 to the N-terminus of T7RNAP. We expected that our
mutator, eMutaT7, would mainly generate the C→T muta-
tions on the coding strand, because transcription process
exposes the coding strand as a single-stranded DNA that is
the main target of PmCDA1 (Figure 1) (26,27). To control
mutator production and promote utilization in diverse E.
coli strains, we cloned the mutator gene into a plasmid un-
der control of an arabinose-inducible promoter. This plas-
mid also expresses UGI, an inhibitor of uracil–DNA gly-
cosylase (UNG), which increases mutation efficiency in the
ung+ strain (28).

To sensitively detect the gene-specific mutagenesis, we
chose as a model target a conditionally toxic allele of

PAGE 5 OF 10

pheS (pheS A294G), which enables toxic incorporation
of p-chloro-phenylalanine (p-Cl-Phe)
into the cognate
tRNAPhe (29). Because p-Cl-Phe inhibits the growth of the
pheS A294G strain, we reasoned that the mutational in-
activation of pheS A294G could be monitored by count-
ing viable cells in the presence of p-Cl-Phe, while the in
vivo mutagenesis is performed without selection pressure
in the absence of p-Cl-Phe. In particular, the C→T tran-
sition induced by PmCDA1 can generate 13 stop codons
(CAG→TAG) throughout the pheS gene as well as other
potentially inactivating mutations. To minimize the hetero-
geneity of the pheS variants in a single cell, we used a low-
copy-number plasmid to clone pheS A294G between T7
promoter and T7 terminator, and induced its expression
with Isopropyl ␤-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG).

eMutaT7 rapidly generates mutations in the target gene in
vivo
To test the in vivo mutagenesis, we prepared the ung strain
carrying the mutator plasmid and the target plasmid, and
started mutagenesis by adding arabinose and IPTG. We also
assayed the expression of no mutator (empty plasmid), un-
fused PmCDA1 and T7RNAP, and T7RNAP only as neg-
ative controls. After three cycles of 4-h growth and 100-fold
dilution to new media (Figure 2A), cells taken at each cycle
were grown on agar plates either with or without p-Cl-Phe
to determine the suppression level of the PheS A294G toxi-
city (Supplementary Figure S1). Cells with an empty vector
express neither T7RNAP nor PheS A294G, and thus were
not included in the suppression experiment. Indeed, cells
expressing eMutaT7 showed a notable increase of suppres-
sor frequency over three cycles (12 h), compared to those
producing T7RNAP only or unfused proteins (Figure 2B).
In particular, the suppressor frequency was almost satu-
rated after three cycles, indicating that most cells have ei-
ther the inactivated pheS A294G gene or off-target muta-
tions that suppress the PheS A294G toxicity. Additional
tests showed that the wild-type strain had lower suppres-
sor frequency than the ung strain, and that cell growth in
different setups––Erlenmeyer flask, test tube, and 96-well
plate––did not yield significant difference (Supplementary
Figure S2).

Next, we determined if eMutaT7 indeed introduces mu-
tations in the target gene. To accumulate mutations, we con-
tinued the mutagenesis up to 27 cycles (108 h or 4.5 days)
in the absence of p-Cl-Phe. Then, we randomly picked up
five clones at various cycles to sequence the target gene
by Sanger method. Remarkably, mutations accumulated
very quickly: the average mutation rate was ∼3.7 mutations
day−1 kb−1 or ∼9.4 × 10−5 mutations base−1 generation−1
in ∼1.1 kb of the target gene region (Figure 2C and Sup-
plementary Figure S3A). This mutation rate is 7–11-fold
higher than that of MutaT7 (11), paralleling those of typ-
ical directed evolution experiments using in vitro mutagen-
esis (typically 2–5 mutations gene−1) (30). By contrast, we
found no mutation in cells grown without eMutaT7 (Fig-
ure 2C). The number of mutations increased with the cycle
number, suggesting that eMutaT7 has not been inactivated
during mutagenesis cycles. As expected in the scheme (Fig-
ure 1), the C→T mutation (208 mutations, 96%) dominated

G→A (eight mutations, 4%). These mutations were widely
distributed throughout the target gene region (Supplemen-
tary Figure S3B).

Because the mutator expression is induced by arabi-
nose, we reasoned that we could control the mutation rate
by changing the amount of arabinose. Indeed, the lower
amounts of arabinose reduced suppressor frequency, indi-
cating that this in vivo mutagenesis is tunable (Figure 2D).
High mutation frequency in the genome may result in lower
cell viability, as shown by the 1000-fold reduction of cell
number with MP6, which randomly generates mutations in
the genome (31) (Figure 2E and Supplementary Figure S4).
eMutaT7, however, did not show any notable reduction of
cells, indicating that eMutaT7 has no significant toxicity
(Figure 2E). To evaluate the level of off-target mutagenesis
in the genome, we determined the rifampicin resistance fre-
quency of cells at cycle 27 with or without mutator expres-
sion. We found that the rifampicin resistance frequencies
were similar between cells grown with and without eMu-
taT7, suggesting that genome-wide off-target mutagenesis
is not frequent with eMutaT7 (Figure 2F). We also tested
fusion of PmCDA1 to the C-terminus of T7RNAP, vari-
ous linker lengths between PmCDA1 and T7RNAP, and
T7RNAP mutations that reduce transcription elongation
speed (32,33) and possibly increase the time for deamina-
tion, but found the original form to be the best among all
variants we tested (Supplementary Figure S5).

High-throughput sequencing confirms the gene-specific mu-
tagenesis by eMutaT7
To comprehensively analyze the gene-specific mutagene-
sis, we sequenced ∼3.3 kb DNA around the target gene
from cells taken at cycle 27 by Illumina sequencing. We
found that, among all substitution types, only the C→T
and G→A mutations were significantly accumulated in the
presence of eMutaT7 (1.72% and 0.22%, respectively; Fig-
ure 3A). Among three regions––upstream, the target gene,
and downstream––the target gene region had the highest av-
erage frequency of C→T mutation (3.6%) compared to the
upstream (0.27%) and downstream (0.96%) regions (Figure
3B). This result indicates that eMutaT7 preferentially mod-
ifies the target gene. eMutaT7 generally raised the mutation
frequency in all three regions, and, in particular, the down-
stream region showed a higher mutation frequency than
the upstream region, suggesting leakage of gene targeting.
However, we believe that the off-target mutations were not
randomly introduced in the genome, as indicated in the low
rifampicin resistance frequency (Figure 2F). Interestingly,
we found that the G→A mutations were mainly enriched in
the ∼280 bp region from the transcription start site (Figure
3C). One possibility is that the longer the newly synthesized
RNA, the better it protects the template DNA strand (the
non-coding strand) from PmCDA1-mediated deamination.
We also found that pyrimidine-C-purine (YCR) is the pre-
ferred but not exclusive sequence for eMutaT7 (Supplemen-
tary Figure S6).

eMutaT7 introduces mutations faster than MutaT7
Although above results suggest that the mutation rate of
eMutaT7 is faster than that of MutaT7, the apparent dis-

parity may rise from different growth conditions, strains,
and target genes. To directly compare the mutation rates
of eMutaT7 and MutaT7, we constructed two plasmids ex-
pressing MutaT7 under control of either the PBAD promoter
that is also used for eMutaT7, or the PA1lacO promoter that
is adopted by the original MutaT7 system. To efficiently
generate G→A mutations as well as C→T, we used the
Shoulders group’s dual promoter/terminator approach, in
which a second pair of T7 promoter/terminator transcribes
the target gene in the reverse direction (Figure 4A) (11). We
found that this approach suppressed the pheS A294G tox-
icity in the same level as the previous approach, but intro-
duced many more G→A mutations (24%; Supplementary
Figure S7). We prepared three strains expressing eMutaT7
or MutaT7 from either promoters, and subjected three in-
dependent cultures from each strain to nine cycles of 4-hour
growth and 100-fold dilution (total 36 h). We randomly

picked up two colonies from each culture, and determined
the sequence of the target pheS A294G gene (total six se-
quences from each strain). We found that PBAD eMutaT7,
PBAD MutaT7 and PA1lacO MutaT7 on average generated
6.8, 1.0 and 0.33 mutations, respectively (Figure 4B and
Supplementary Figure S8). This result demonstrates that
eMutaT7 indeed has the higher mutation rate than Mu-
taT7.

eMutaT7 promotes rapid continuous directed evolution of
model proteins
We next tested eMutaT7 for evolution of proteins us-
ing the dual promoter/terminator approach. We evolved a
class A ␤-lactamase, TEM-1, for resistance against third-
generation cephalosporin antibiotics, cefotaxime (CTX)
and ceftazidime (CAZ) (Figure 5A). We tested multiple an-

tibiotic concentrations at the same time, of which the cells
grown at the highest concentration were subjected to the
next round of growth in fresh media with higher amounts
of antibiotics (Figure 5A). The minimum inhibitory con-
centrations (MICs) increased from 0.06 to 400–800 ␮g/ml
in 32 h of in vivo CDE for CTX, and from 0.2 to 2000–
4000 ␮g/ml in 24 h for CAZ (Figure 5B, C and Supplemen-
tary Figure S9). These results present a much faster evolu-
tion of antibiotic resistance than that of previous reports
using traditional directed evolution methods: 3–5 rounds
of in vitro mutagenesis, transformation, and selection for
CTX (34,35), and 3–4 rounds for CAZ (36,37). Sanger se-
quencing of five colonies revealed that all the samples share
two previously reported mutations (E102K and G236S for
CTX; E102K and R162H for CAZ), which are located near
the substrate binding site, and thus might alter the sub-
strate specificity of the enzyme (Figure 5D and E). We also
evolved AmpC, a class C ␤-lactamase, for resistance against
carbenicillin (CB) and MICs increased from 16 ␮g/ml to
2000–4000 ␮g/ml in 28 h (Supplementary Figure S10). Al-
though most clinical isolates that are resistant to ampicillin
contain mutations on the promoter region of ampC (38),
our experiment revealed some mutations near the substrate
binding site (e.g. G214R/S, D217N and E196K) (Supple-
mentary Figure S10).

Finally, we attempted to find an allosteric mutation of
DegP, the major heat-shock protease in bacterial periplasm.
The proteolytic activity of DegP is carefully controlled
to maintain cellular fitness under heat stress: the lower
and higher activity reduce bacterial fitness by misfolded
protein stress and hyper-proteolysis, respectively (16). Al-

though many activity-lowering allosteric mutations have
been found, only one activating mutation was reported (16).
We started with a less active variant, DegP A184S, which re-
duced the cell viability at high temperature, and evolved new
variants that support better cellular growth at high temper-
ature, by increasing temperature stepwise during growth cy-
cles (Figure 6A). We expected that the new variants should
have a compensating mutation that increases the proteolytic
activity of DegP A184S. Sanger sequencing of the degP
gene from five colonies revealed P231L as the only com-
mon mutation (Figure 6A and Supplementary Figure S11).
Indeed, the addition of P231L in DegP A184S restored the
cell viability at high temperature (43◦C), and P231L alone
reduced cell viability (Figure 6B). Also the in vitro enzy-
matic assay showed that P231L raises the basal activity,
and the addition of P231L increased the basal activity of
DegP A184S to the level of wild-type DegP, indicating the
rebalancing of proteolytic activity (Figure 6C). The P231
residue is located near the center of the trimeric DegP with-
out direct contact with the substrate, suggesting that P231L
allosterically increases activity (Figure 6D). Collectively, we
demonstrated that our mutator allows rapid in vivo directed
evolution of a target protein, given the continuous selection
condition.

In conclusion, we demonstrate that the orthogonal RNA
polymerase fused to a more efficient cytidine deaminase
promotes rapid continuous directed evolution of proteins
via gene-specific in vivo mutagenesis. To our knowledge,
eMutaT7 has the highest mutation rate among the targeted
in vivo mutagenesis methods for CDE of proteins. In theory,
a 100 mL culture with a constant OD600 ∼0.1 (∼1010 cells)

can generate 1010 independent variants of a 1-kb gene every
6 h with eMutaT7. Also, our method is (i) simple: two plas-
mids expressing an mutator and a target are sufficient for
gene-specific CDE and any laboratory with a basic molecu-
lar biology setup can use this method; (ii) expandable: mul-
tiple genes under control of T7 promoter can be targeted
and (iii) tunable: mutation rates can be controlled by the
arabinose concentration. A major limitation of our method
is the narrow mutational spectrum in which the C→T and
G→A mutations dominate. However, we believe that fusion
of different DNA-modifying enzymes to T7RNAP will help
expand the substitution types, while maintaining specificity
and speed of the in vivo mutagenesis. Alternatively, gene li-
braries constructed by in vitro mutagenesis can be a starting
point of CDE, in which our in vivo mutagenesis method ex-
plores an additional layer of sequence space.
