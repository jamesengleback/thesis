the all-atom additive charmm36 protein force field is widely 
used in molecular modeling and simulations. We present 
its refinement, charmm36m (http://mackerell.umaryland.
edu/charmm_ff.shtml), with improved accuracy in generating 
polypeptide backbone conformational ensembles for 
intrinsically disordered peptides and proteins. 

There is increasing interest in intrinsically disordered peptides 
and  proteins  (IDPs)  due  to  their  abundance  and  functional 
importance in eukaryotes, as well as their association with vari-
ous human disorders ranging from cancer to neurodegenerative 
diseases. Rather than folding into a single, well-defined three-
dimensional structure, an IDP fluctuates between an ensemble of 
interconverting conformational states, which allows some IDPs 
to interact with several different binding partners, thereby func-
tioning in protein–protein interaction networks1. Experimental 
characterization of conformational ensembles of IDPs is challeng-
ing; assistance from computer simulations is often needed, as the 
number of degrees of freedom of an IDP far exceed the number 
of available experimental observables2. Recent advances in hard-
ware and software allow molecular simulations to reach relevant 
timescales for sampling IDP conformations, but a major limiting 
factor lies in the accuracy of their underlying models, typically 
empirical force fields (FFs)3. Protein FFs were mostly developed 
to target folded proteins, and their accuracy in modeling IDPs 
needs to be scrutinized and improved4–6.

In a recent benchmark study on the structural ensembles of a 
disordered arginine–serine (RS) peptide obtained with different 
force fields4, the CHARMM36 (C36) protein FF7 was found to 
generate a high population of left-handed α-helix (αL), incon-
sistent with NMR spectroscopy and small-angle X-ray scatter-
ing  (SAXS)  experimental  measurements.  We  now  present  an 
improved C36 FF based on a refined backbone CMAP poten-
tial8 derived from reweighting calculation (see Online Methods) 

and a better description of specific salt bridge interactions (see  
Online Methods). We validate the modified FF, CHARMM36m 
(C36m), using a comprehensive set of 15 peptides and 20 pro-
teins with a cumulative simulation time of more than 500  µs 
(Supplementary Table 1).

The sampling of αL helical conformations in IDP ensembles 
generated with the C36m FF is significantly lower than that in 
ensembles generated with C36, as we demonstrated for four IDPs 
including the RS peptide, the FG-nucleoporin peptide, a hen egg 
white lysozyme N-terminal fragment (HEWL19) and the N-ter-
minal domain of HIV-1 integrase (IN) (Table 1). The average αL 
propensity of non-glycine, non-proline residues for these four 
IDPs changes between the two FFs from 20.0% to 5.7%, much 
closer to the value of 5.1% obtained from protein-coil libraries9. 
With the bias toward αL sampling removed, the C36m FF gener-
ates molecular dynamics (MD) ensembles that improve the pre-
diction of experimental observables, for example, the NMR scalar 
couplings for the central alanine residues in the HEWL19 peptide 
(Supplementary Table 2). The ensemble obtained with C36m for 
the RS peptide is in significantly better agreement with NMR data 
(J couplings, chemical shifts and hydrodynamic radius) than is the 
RS peptide ensemble obtained with C36 (Supplementary Tables 3  
and 4). In addition, the predicted SAXS profile from the C36m 
ensemble of the RS peptide agrees (within the margin of error) 
with the experimental SAXS curve (Fig. 1), indicating good agree-
ment between computed and measured chain dimensions.

We  tested  secondary  structure  sampling  for  a  number  of 
model peptides. The fraction of right-handed α-helices in the 
Ac-(AAQAA)3-NH2 peptide simulated with the C36m FF is 17%, 
which is larger than the C36 result of 13% and closer to the NMR 
estimates of ~19% and ~21% at 300 K (Supplementary Fig. 1 and 
Supplementary Table 5). We carried out folding simulations of 
four β-hairpins (GB1, chignolin, CLN025 and Nrf2); starting from 
unfolded, fully extended conformations, native-like β-hairpin  
structures were sampled for all four peptides (Supplementary 
Figs. 2–5). For the GB1 β-hairpin, the MD ensembles gener-
ated by the C36m and C36 FFs were found to be very similar 
(Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3) and consistent with NMR esti-
mate of the folded state population10. However, the folded state 
populations of chignolin and CLN025 are substantially lower than 
the NMR estimates (Supplementary Table 6), indicating that the 
C36m FF may underestimate the stability of some β-hairpins.

To directly compare to previous C36 results11, we tested C36m 
by simulating polyglutamine (polyQ) peptide, an IDP with rel-
atively compact collapsed states due to the hydrogen bonding 
interactions between polar side chains. Similar to the C36 results, 
the 30-residue polyQ peptide (Q30) was found to be disordered

The αL probability is computed as the fraction of the ensemble containing left-handed 
α-helices, and the αL propensity is computed as the probability for non-glycine, non-proline 
residues to sample the αL region. The maximum length of the αL helices observed in the 
simulations is also listed.

during 98% of the simulation time. On average, 7% of φ and ψ  
torsion angles were in the αL region with C36m. A broad confor-
mational ensemble was sampled, with the most favorable states 
being relatively compact (first major minimum at the end-to-
end distance of 25 Å; Supplementary Fig. 6). Extrapolation of 
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements of 
shorter polyglutamine peptides12 to a length of 30 residues leads 
to an estimate of end-to-end distance of 25 Å, which compares 
favorably with the C36m simulation results.

We also tested C36m in modeling the kinetics of protein dynam-
ics with the disordered Ac-C(AGQ)nW-NH2 peptides. The C-ter-
minal tryptophan of C(AGQ)nW peptides can be optically excited 
into the triplet state, with the rate of quenching of that state due 
to contact formation with the N-terminal cysteine corresponding 
to the rate of loop closure13,14. The decay of triplet survival prob-
abilities calculated from MD simulations compares favorably with 
experiments for four C(AGQ)nW peptides with n = 1–4 at 293 K 
(Supplementary Fig. 7). The computed loop closure rates, as well as 
both their diffusion-limited parts and their reaction-limited parts, 
agree with results for shorter peptides (n = 1 or 2) (Supplementary 
Table 7)14. The calculated diffusion-limited rates for longer pep-
tides (n = 3 or 4) are higher than experimental estimations, indicat-
ing that the simulation ensembles are too collapsed.

We also validated C36m using 15 different folded proteins. All 
were stable during the 1-µs simulation time (Supplementary Fig. 8),  
and the distribution of backbone φ and ψ dihedral angles from 
these simulations closely resembles the Ramachandran plot of 
the ‘top 500’ protein structures15 (Supplementary Fig. 9), indica-
tive of the high quality of the C36m FF in treating the backbone 
conformational properties of folded proteins. NMR observables 
of ubiquitin computed from microsecond MD simulations with 
the C36m FF correlate well with both the C36 results and experi-
mental data (Supplementary Tables 8–12).

We  additionally  performed  a  folding  free  energy  calcula-
tion of villin headpiece (HP) 36 (Supplementary Table 13 and 
Supplementary Fig. 10); conformational sampling of an N-terminal  
fragment  of  HP36,  HP21  (Supplementary  Figs.  11–14);  and 
MD simulations of designed proteins GA95 and GB95 with 95% 
sequence identity but different folds (Supplementary Fig. 15). The 
HP21 peptide folds to the correct folded state (Supplementary 
Fig. 11), consistent with the fact that the peptide is partially folded 
and has a preference for its native structure16. The most predomi-
nant secondary structure is α-helix (Supplementary Fig. 12),

nonweighted error function χ2, as defined in ref. 20, was 0.63 using C36 
and 0.12 using C36m. The error bars represent the s.d., computed by

bars are smaller than the line width.

as expected based on NMR studies16 and a recent simulation 
study of this peptide17. The helical state is slightly destabilized (by 
~1kT) as compared to the population, as inferred from the chemi-
cal shifts and secondary structure propensity (Supplementary  
Fig. 13 and Supplementary Tables 14 and 15). For the HP36 pro-
tein, we find that C36m gives improved agreement in the folding 
free energy compared to C36 (Supplementary Table 13).

Finally, we comment on the general problem of overly com-
pact IDP ensembles, a problem that is encountered with most 
physics-based atomistic models5,6,18. While the C36m FF, based 
on the CHARMM-modified TIP3P water model, leads to good 
agreement between computed and experimental chain dimen-
sions for the RS peptide, the ensemble averaged radii of gyra-
tion (Rg) of IN and the cold-shock protein from Thermotoga 
maritima  (CspTm)  with  the  C36m  FF  are  13.8  ±  0.2  Å  and  
12.8 ± 0.2 Å (data presented as mean ± s.e.m.). These dimensions 
are much smaller than the experimental estimates of 24 Å and 15 Å  
(Supplementary Table 16)19, respectively, which are inferred 
from FRET measurements assuming a Gaussian chain model. 
An approach to correct for this bias is to increase the dispersion 
interactions between the protein and water. One study applied a 
general scaling factor to scale up the total protein–water van der 
Waals interactions5, while another proposed a reparametrized 
water model with the oxygen Lennard–Jones (LJ) well depth εO 
increased by 50% (ref. 6). Motivated by the difference between 
the CHARMM-modified water model and the original TIP3P 
water model, we propose here an alternative water model in 
which the LJ well depth parameter εH of the water hydrogen 
atoms is increased (from −0.046 kcal/mol in CHARMM TIP3P) 
while the oxygen LJ parameters and the water–water interactions 
are maintained. This approach specifically makes the dispersion 
part of protein–water interactions more favorable, with minimal 
perturbation on the repulsive part versus the larger impact of 
altering the oxygen LJ parameters (see Online Methods).

In  simulations  using  a  water  model  in  which  the εH  value  
was set to −0.10 kcal/mol, we obtained good agreement with the 
experimentally estimated Rg for CspTm (Supplementary Tables 16  

and 17). In contrast, computed ensemble averaged <Rg> values 
were found to be larger than the experimental value for the RS 
peptide and smaller than the experimental value for the IN protein 
(Supplementary Fig. 16 and Supplementary Table 16). These 
results suggest that no universal εH can be found to be applicable 
to all IDP systems and that IDP specific water models may be of 
utility; further studies are required to address this issue.

The origin of left-handed a-helices in the C36 protein FF. Left- 
handed helices are very rare in peptides and proteins due to the 
steric clash between amino acid side-chains and the CO groups, 
which are bulkier than the NH group, in the case of common right-
handed helices. Though present in both models (Supplementary 
Fig. 17), such steric effect is weaker in the C36 FF compared to the 
C22/CMAP FF, because of the inclusion of refined Lennard–Jones 
(LJ) parameters for aliphatic carbon atoms in the C36 FF that give 
improved condensed-phase properties of alkanes21. Specifically, 
the van der Waals (vdW) radius of alanine Cβ atoms changed 
from 2.06 Å in C22/CMAP to 2.04 Å in C36; for the Cβ atoms in 
Ile, Thr and Val from 2.275 Å to 2.0 Å; and for the Cβ atoms in the 
remaining non-Gly, non-Pro amino acids from 2.175 Å to 2.01 Å.  
Notably,  these  changes  also  represent  improved  treatment  in 
the FF of intramolecular interactions, as the CMAP corrections 
to the original C22 FF contain large negative values in the αL 
region to account for the steric clash disfavoring αL being over-
estimated due to the larger vdW radii. As improved LJ parameters 
were adopted in the C36 FF, a decrease in the contribution of 
the CMAP correction that favors αL was needed. However, as 
the original C36 CMAP (Supplementary Fig. 17) has the same 
CMAP potential in the αL region as C22/CMAP, oversampling of 
the αL region occurs, requiring the present additional refinement 
and subsequent validation of the model.

Optimization of the CMAP potential. Central to any optimiza-
tion problem is its target function. While left-handed α-helices 
are very rare, there is little qualitative experimental information 
on the probability or the average length of left-handed helices 
or on how often an amino acid populates the αL conformation. 
Protein-coil libraries9,15 estimate an average αL propensity of 
6.4% for all amino acids and 5.1% for non-Gly, non-Pro resi-
dues. It is anticipated that αL propensity in different IDPs will 
depend on their primary sequence22,23, and arguments on the 
amount of αL sampled in specific peptides date back to earlier 
days of molecular mechanics force fields24–26. As experimental 
target data on the correct amount of αL population is lacking, 
we instead attempted to answer a related and more general ques-
tion: what is the minimal perturbation of the current CMAP 
potential energy, E, that reduces αL sampling to an approximate 
target  value?  This  corresponds  to  minimizing  the  following  
target function:

where n is the number of frames, hi is a binary that equals 1 if the 
ith conformation contains a left helix and 0 if not, and ∆EiCMAP 
is  the  potential  energy  change  associated  with  the  CMAP 
modification at the ith conformation. The reweighted αL prob-
ability was determined based on ∆EiCMAP, as this was the only  
energy term adjusted in the FF that directly impacts backbone 
conformational sampling, which allows efficient evaluation of the 
target function.

A  Monte  Carlo  simulated  annealing  (MCSA)  simulation 
is  combined  with  the  reweighting  equation  (equation  (4))  to 
derive  the  optimized  CMAP  potential  for  the  target  function 
(Supplementary Fig. 18). We carried out 105 MCSA steps with a 
starting MCSA temperature of 10 K, and random CMAP revisions 
between −0.01 kcal/mol and +0.01 kcal/mol were added to indi-
vidual grid points in a broadly defined αL region (Supplementary 
Fig. 18) in each MC step. The full set of φ and ψ values of the 
FG-nucleoporin (FG) peptide from the MD ensemble generated 
with the C36 FF at 298 K (ref. 4) was used as the input data, and 
MCSA optimizations were run with different weighting factor w 
values (Supplementary Table 18). Smaller w values lead to more 
pronounced reduction of αL probability, indicating that w bal-
ances between the amount of αL and the magnitude of the CMAP 
modification. The predicted αL probability drops to 1.1% with  
w = 2kT, and further decreases of w bring little improvement in αL 
reduction (Supplementary Table 18). The CMAP resulting from 
a 105 step MCSA run with w = 2kT is determined to be used as the 
CMAP for non-Gly and non-Pro residues in the C36m FF. The 
revision to the original C36 CMAP is localized to the αL region 
around φ = 60° and ψ = 45°, and is much smaller than with the 
full region allowed to optimize, as indicated by the black lines 
in Supplementary Figure 18. The final number of parameters 
(i.e., CMAP grid points) being modified is much smaller than 
the number of parameters allowed to freely change during fit-
ting, which is a good indication that overfitting has been avoided. 
The penalty term (RMSCMAP) in the optimization target function 
helps maintain minimal revision to the CMAP potential while 
maximally reducing the αL probability.

Improved  modeling  of  the  guanidinium  and  carboxylate 
salt  bridge.  Another  refinement  in  the  C36m  FF  concerns

nonbonded LJ parameter (NBFIX term in CHARMM) between the 
guanidinium nitrogen in arginine and the carboxylate oxygen in 
glutamate, aspartate and the C terminus. This salt bridge interaction 
was found to be too favorable in the CHARMM protein force fields, 
as indicated by the overestimation of the equilibrium association 
constant of a guanidinium acetate solution30,31 and by the underes-
timation of its osmotic pressure (B. Roux, personal communication). 
The added NBFIX term increases the Rmin from 3.55 Å (based on 
the Lorentz-Berthelot rule) to a larger value of 3.637 Å (R. Shen and 
B. Roux, personal communication), which we subsequently showed 
improves the agreement with the experimental osmotic pressure of 
guanidinium acetate solutions (Supplementary Fig. 19). We note 
that the NBFIX approach employed here differs from Piana et al.’s 
work25, where the CHARMM22 charges of the Arg, Asp and Glu side 
chains were reduced in magnitude, with both approaches leading to 
weaker and more realistic salt-bridge interactions. The NBFIX term 
ensures that only the specific interaction between Arg and Asp/Glu is 
modified, while the interactions of these residues with other amino 
acids, water or ions are maintained as in the C36 FF. Again, our aim 
is to improve the C36 FF with minimal changes in the model.

Molecular dynamics simulations. The C36m FF was validated 
using  a  variety  of  systems  including  peptides,  IDPs,  unfolded 
states of proteins and globular proteins. The CHARMM-modi-
fied  TIP3P  model32  was  used  in  all  simulations,  unless  noted. 
All the systems studied here are in high dilution, such that the 
systems did not test the force fields with respect to aggregation.  
A summary of the validation simulations is given in Supplementary 
Table 1, and detailed information of setup and analysis for each 
simulation system is given in the Supplementary Note. Briefly, 
temperature replica exchange (T-REX) simulations were carried 
out with GROMACS33 for the RS peptide (0.63 µs × 34 replicas), 
the GB1 hairpin (0.8 µs × 32 replicas), the Nrf2 hairpin (1 µs × 
28 replicas), chignolin (6 µs × 29 replicas) and CLN025 (6 µs × 
29 replicas). Hamiltonian replica exchange (H-REX) simulation 
was carried out with CHARMM34 for polyQ using the end-to-end 
distance as the biasing reaction coordinate. Harmonic umbrella 
potentials with a force constant of 0.2 kcal/mol/Å2 were applied 
to target end-to-end distances ranging from 5 to 75 Å, spaced at 
5-Å intervals. A similar H-REX protocol, using distance as the 
biasing reaction coordinate, was applied to study the folding free 
energy of HP21. Conformations were also sampled using single, 
long-MD trajectories with OpenMM35, including 5-µs simulations 
for the HEWL19 peptide, IN and CspTm, 10-µs simulations for the 
(AGQ)n peptides and 16-µs simulations for (AAQAA)3. A 1.2-µs 
simulation of ubiquitin was carried out with NAMD to compare 
with previous results using the C36 FF36. Alternative water models 
were tested with the RS peptide using T-REX simulations (0.63 µs × 
34 replicas) and with IN and CspTm using 5-µs MD simulations.
Analysis of MD trajectories was carried out using GROMACS33 
or CHARMM34. A left-handed α-helix is defined as having at least 
three consecutive residues with φ and ψ falling in the αL region 
(30° < φ < 100° and 7° < ψ < 67°; Supplementary Fig. 20). The αL 
probability is computed as the fraction of the ensemble containing 
left-handed α-helices, as in ref. 4. We also compute the αL frac-
tion as the probability for residues to be in a left-handed α-helix 
and calculate the αL propensity as the probability for residues’ 
φ and ψ to be in the αL region as an additional measurement of 
left-handed α-helix sampling.

Statistics. Observables were computed as the ensemble average 
of ~104 to 106 frames in MD trajectories. Unless otherwise noted, 
uncertainties were estimated with block analysis by partitioning 
MD trajectories into five blocks (n = 5).

Sampling extended states of IDPs with alternative water model. 
A promising way to obtain larger <Rg> is to introduce stronger 
dispersion interactions between the protein and water. We first 
test the approach suggested by Best et al.5, which employs a gen-
eral scaling factor for the vdW interaction between protein and 
water. A scaling factor of 1.05 is tested with the C36m FF and 
confirms that scaling up protein–water vdW interaction leads to 
more extended conformational states for the RS peptide, the IN 
proteins and the CspTm proteins (Supplementary Fig. 16 and 
Supplementary Table 16).

We propose an alternative water model with specific modi-
fication of water hydrogen LJ parameters. This is inspired by 
the difference in conformational sampling with the CHARMM 
modified TIP3P model and with the original TIP3P model. The 
CHARMM modified TIP3P contains additional LJ parameters on 
the hydrogen atoms (εH = −0.046 kcal/mol and Rmin/2 = 0.2245 
Å), so it has more favorable dispersion interactions, which sta-
bilize extended conformations, leading to less-structured con-
formational ensembles as compared to the original TIP3P water 
model4,37. By further increasing the εH value while maintaining 
the LJ parameters of the water oxygen atom and resetting the 
water–water interaction to be same as the CHARMM-modified 
TIP3P water with NBFIX terms, one can specifically make the 
dispersion part of the vdW interactions between protein and 
water more favorable while not perturbing the water properties. 
The advantage of altering the εH value is due to the LJ poten-
tial containing both repulsion (r−12) and dispersion (r−6) terms. 
Therefore, altering the water oxygen atom LJ parameters will 
affect its effective size based on the repulsive term such that, for 
example, the change would alter the balance between the attrac-
tive and repulsive interactions of water–protein interactions. In 
contrast, the water hydrogen atom has a very small LJ radius, so 
its repulsive wall remains inside the repulsive wall of the oxygen 
atom in such a way that its LJ term only contributes favorable dis-
persion interactions. Thus, by only modifying the hydrogen LJ εH 
parameter, we ensure minimal perturbation of the Hamiltonian, 
i.e., only the dispersion interaction of the protein with water in 
the simulation systems is changed. As our goal in the present 
study was to verify that such an approach would lead to improved 
sampling of IDPs, we approximately doubled the εH value from 
−0.046 to −0.1 kcal/mol.

Data  availability.  The  C36m  FF  is  available  along  with  the 
remainder  of  the  CHARMM  force  fields  at  http://mackerell. 
umaryland.edu/charmm_ff.shtml. More specifically, the param-
eter file (par_all36m_prot.prm) is provided in the toppar_c36_
jul16.tgz file. The C36m FF is also included in the CHARMM 
program (version c41 and onward). In addition, the FF may be 
used in a number of open source molecular simulation programs 
including NAMD, GROMACS and OpenMM.
