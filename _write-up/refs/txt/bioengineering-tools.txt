Abstract
Evolutionary approaches have been providing solutions to various bioengineering challenges in an efficient manner. In 
addition to traditional adaptive laboratory evolution and directed evolution, recent advances in synthetic biology and fluidic 
systems have opened a new era of evolutionary engineering. Synthetic genetic circuits have been created to control mutagen-
esis and enable screening of various phenotypes, particularly metabolite production. Fluidic systems can be used for high-
throughput screening and multiplexed continuous cultivation of microorganisms. Moreover, continuous directed evolution 
has been achieved by combining all the steps of evolutionary engineering. Overall, modern tools and systems for evolutionary 
engineering can be used to establish the artificial equivalent to natural evolution for various research applications.

Introduction

Evolution enables living organisms to survive and adapt to 
changing environments. The mechanism underlying this 
process, descent with modification, not only shapes nature 
but also help researchers to engineer useful phenotypes. 
Adaptive laboratory evolution reproduces natural evolution 
in a research laboratory by passaging microbial cultures 
under selective pressures to which the cell must adapt [22, 
48, 59, 66]. The evolutionary process has also been mim-
icked through directed evolution of enzymes [1, 14, 79], in 
which variants of a target gene are generated in vitro and 
transformed to cells and selected for the desired phenotype 
such as binding affinity. These evolutionary engineering 
approaches have emerged as important strategies for bio-
engineering. Numerous technologies are used in each step, 

Sungho Jang and Minsun Kim have contributed equally to this 
work.

with thenext-generation sequencing (NGS) technology ena-
bling determination of genotype–phenotype relationships 
after the evolution [40, 71, 95].

In  addition  to  the  traditional  technologies,  recent 
advances in synthetic biology have improved the efficiency 
of evolutionary engineering and broadened the field to which 
these approaches can be applied. In vivo mutagenesis meth-
ods increased the library size and reduced the time and labor 
required to generate a library [105]. Genetically encoded 
biosensors have expanded the range of phenotypes that 
can be selected beyond the tolerance to stress and binding 
affinity of a ligand [51]. Microfluidic systems enabled high-
throughput, single-cell screening [6, 43]. Synthetic genetic 
circuits and continuous evolution systems facilitated whole 
evolution cycles by reducing or even eliminating interven-
tions by researchers.

In this review, we describe recent progress in evolu-
tionary engineering of biomolecules and microorganisms 
(Fig. 1). The main objective of this article is to provide an 
updated view of the tools and systems useful for accelerat-
ing evolutionary engineering. Therefore, we focus on the 
methods used in each step of evolutionary engineering: 
diversity generation and phenotype screening. Thereafter, a 
more advanced concept for an efficient evolution known as 
continuous directed evolution will be explained that requires 
least interventions by researchers such as PCR, cloning, and 
transformation.

Tools and systems for generating diversity

Directed evolution guides a mutant pool towards desired 
phenotypes by associating the phenotype with the fitness 
of a variant in the iterative cycle of diversity generation, 
selection, and amplification. A concept of the fitness land-
scape is generally used to illustrate the effect of a genetic 
variation to a given phenotype of interest. In the fitness 
landscape, the horizontal plane represents different genetic 
variations and the magnitude of the phenotype of interest 
for each genetic variation is plotted as height. Because 
the fitness landscape resembles a mountain range, we can 
interpret the goal of evolutionary engineering as climb-
ing up the fitness landscape to reach a maximum peak 
where the genetic variation at such a point results in the 
phenotype of interest at its maximum [73]. To successfully 
evolve biomolecules, genetic pathways, or even genomes 
in a directed manner, it is crucial that the evolution sys-
tem meets three fundamental criteria. (i) The mutant 
library should be designed to contain sufficient genetic 
diversity to increase the probability of reaching a maxi-
mum peak in the fitness landscape [73]. (ii) Appropriate 
selection pressure should be applied to eliminate inferior 
mutants, so that propagation of false-positives or cheater 
mutants is minimized [86, 102]. (iii) The evolution cycle 

should be easily iterated for efficient evolution of a desired 
phenotype.

In vitro mutagenesis technologies such as error-prone 
PCR and DNA shuffling have been broadly utilized for 
directed evolution [82, 103, 104], as they allow a tunable 
mutation window in a targeted region. Nevertheless, in vitro 
mutagenesis is labor-intensive and involves sub-cloning and 
transformation, which leads to significant loss of the mutant 
pool because of the limited transformation efficiency [4, 18]. 
To overcome the drawbacks of in vitro methods and repeat 
iterative cycles of directed evolution, in vivo approaches 
have been developed by creating mutagenesis machinery 
in the cell. However, typical in vivo mutagenesis such as 
hypermutator strains [29, 30] or mutator plasmids [3, 78] 
involve the risk of accumulating detrimental mutations in the 
host genome, because every genetic information in the cell is 
equally affected by mutagenesis [70]. As random mutagen-
esis (non-targeted, global) threatens the viability of the host 
cell and eventually directed evolution, orthogonality, the 
ability to focus mutations only to a target site (targeted) not 
to non-target sites (Fig. 2a), has become an integral fea-
ture of in vivo mutagenesis while showing a good muta-
tion rate, window, and spectrum. Here, we reviewed several 
mutagenesis tools (Table 1) according to their strategies to 
achieve the orthogonality of mutagenesis by (i) implement-
ing an orthogonal cis–trans pair, (ii) detouring the central

dogma, (iii) repurposing a pair of programmed guide RNA 
and CRISPR-associated endonuclease, and (iv) exploiting 
the infectious cycle of phage. 

Orthogonal pair: ColE1/Pol1, OrthoRep, TaG‑TEAM, 
Muta T7

It is pivotal to mutate the target sequence while maintain-
ing the genomic integrity and error-prone capacity of the 
mutagenesis machinery to sustain directed evolution contin-
uously within the cell. To minimize the interaction of error-
generating machinery with unwanted genetic loci, orthogo-
nal replication pairs are employed as in vivo mutagenesis 
tools.

The ColE1 origin found in bacterial plasmid requires 
initial transient catalyzation of DNA polymerase I (Pol I) 
for its distinct replication machinery. Given the complete 
reliance on Pol I, ColE1 provides the cis element for tar-
geted mutation and amplification [10]. Through catalysis 
by error-prone Pol I encoded in another plasmid, the gene 
of interest localized downstream of the ColE1 origin can 
acquire mutations and replicate simultaneously. Although 
unwanted chromosomal mutation is inevitable because of 
the contribution of DNA polymerase I to Okazaki fragment 
joining and DNA repair [46], mutagenesis performed under 
saturated growth conditions maximizes the gap between the 
plasmid and chromosomal mutation rate. Despite the even 
distribution of mutations, the switch from the error-prone 
Pol I to the endogenous Pol III during the target plasmid 
replication limits the mutation window to 650 base pairs 
(bp) downstream, which has a minimal chance of encoding 
a single gene.

Another orthogonal pair of plasmid and polymerase 
is applied in a yeast-specific mutagenesis tool named as 
OrthoRep [70]. The linear cytoplasmic plasmid pGKL-1 
(p1), derived from Kluyveromyces lactis used in OrthoRep, 
necessitates dimerization of the terminal protein (TP) 
anchored at the terminal end and TP-DNAP for initiation 
of replication [87]. Deduced from the distinctive protein-
primed replication machinery and spatial segregation from 
the chromosome, Ravikumar et al. hypothesized that p1 
could be extended as a vector of the target gene for orthog-
onal mutagenesis and observed an elevated mutation rate 
on p1 using error-prone TP-DNAP1 with minimal cross-
talk between the host chromosome [69]. Recently, they 
further engineered TP-DNAP1 to reduce fidelity without 
impairing processivity, which dramatically increased the 
mutation rate. Error-prone TP-DNAP1 is an indispensa-
ble enzyme for sustaining the replication of p1 and leads 
to the inevitable introduction of mutations on its pair of 
plasmids, preventing impairment of the trans element of 
mutagenesis on the nuclear plasmid. The low off-target 

mutation rate enables the replication over 90 generations 
with a stable mutation rate, which is an important prop-
erty for in vivo mutagenesis to facilitate continuous evolu-
tion. However, the applicable host being confined to the 
yeast strain and meticulous genetic manipulation limits the 
applications of this method.

Finney-Manchester and Maheshri constructed targeting 
glycosylases to embedded arrays for mutagenesis (TaG-
TEAM) system based on base excision repair (BER) and 
the specific interaction between tetR and its cognate opera-
tor, tetO (Fig. 2b) [26]. 3-Methyladenine DNA glycosy-
lase derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a broad 
substrate range and excises alkylated bases in the first step 
of BER [62]. Apyrimidinic/apurinic (AP) sites caused by 
glycosylase are further removed from the phosphate back-
bone through the action of AP endonuclease. However, 
a previous study reported that overexpressed glycosylase 
excises normal base pairs in AP endonuclease knock-outs, 
increasing the spontaneous mutation rate [96, 97]. This is 
because unprocessed AP sites cause stalling of DNA syn-
thesis machinery and recruit error-prone trans-lesion poly-
merase [7]. The authors designed a fusion of non-specific 
yeast glycosylase Mag1 with single-chain tetR (sctetR). 
The fusion protein bound to one of the tetO arrays near the 
mutagenesis target and excised the normal bases nonspe-
cifically. As a result, mutations were observed spanning 
10 kb bi-directionally from the tetO array. TaG-TEAM 
provides a fixed mutation range long enough to contain 
several genes, albeit the mutation rate declines as the dis-
tance from the anchored site increases. Moreover, there are 
tricky requirements; an array of tetO should be embedded 
in the vicinity of GOI and DNA repair machinery in the 
host cell must be partially shut down, which increases the 
risk non-targeted spontaneous mutations.

Adopting a similar concept as a fusion protein, the Muta 
T7 system utilized an orthogonal pair of the T7 promoter 
and cognate polymerase [58]. As opposed to TaG-TEAM 
which induces mutations around tethered sites, the pro-
cessivity of T7 RNA polymerase delivers mutations on 
a sliding template. Thus, Muta T7 can establish a muta-
tion window using the T7 promoter and tandem terminator 
[75]. Moore et al. selected cytidine deaminase as a mutator 
to promote the transition of cytosine to uracil, which is 
recognized as thymine by DNA polymerase. However, the 
accessible mutational spectrum configured by amino acid 
substitution from cytidine deaminase is 32% of the total 
case, which confers mutational bias [31]. To fill this gap, 
an additional T7 promoter is introduced in the opposite 
orientation to broaden the mutation spectrum. Neverthe-
less, A and T remain intact, with the system compromising 
the unreachable landscape of the genotype.

Detour central dogma: ICE (Ty1 retrotransposon), 
retroelement

A mutagenesis tool implementing reverse transcription 
(RT) was established to minimize the interaction with the 
innate cellular machinery of the host that is not equipped 
with reverse transcriptase. Crook et al. applied the yeast 
long terminal repeat transposon Ty1 to enable in vivo con-
tinuous evolution (ICE) (Fig. 2c, upper) [15]. The target 
gene inside the retrotransposon cassette as cargo gains 
mutations in tandem with error-prone transposition. The 
authors optimized factors such as the cargo expression 
level, host factors involved in the transposition rate, and 
induction conditions to increase targeted mutagenesis by 
over 50-fold compared to the wild type and, therefore, 
enlarge the library size in each round. Retroelement-based 
mutagenesis showed a consistent mutation rate across 
cargo and moderate mutation bias compared to mutagenic 
polymerases. Interestingly, by comparing two independent 
in vivo continuous evolution methods, different mutation 
profiles were found to be induced from the Ty1 cassette 
conveying xylose isomerase and one xylulokinase vari-
ant with different consumption rates as a pair. This sup-
ports that the mutation range comprising multiple genes 
requires a parameter in the mutagenesis tool that drives a 
novel evolutionary landscape for metabolic engineering. 
Moreover, by combining the fitness of evolved mutants 
from ep-PCR and the retrotransposon element, more than 
half of the latter surpassed the former. Despite the appeal-
ing performances of the Ty1 retrotransposon cassette as a 

1317

mutagenesis tool, the applicable host is limited to yeast 
strains, which allows Ty1 transposition.

RT-based targeted gene editing machinery operating in 
prokaryotic taxa was reported, followed by the discovery of 
retrotransposons in eukaryotes [25]. Based on the previous 
studies, Simon et al. optimized the editing frequency and 
length for continuous evolution applications (Fig. 2c, lower) 
[81]. In contrast to Ty1-based mutagenesis, mutagenic T7 
RNA polymerase introduce errors on the transcript of mul-
ticopy single-stranded DNA containing a target sequence 
[55]. Error-containing targeting DNA converted by RT edits 
the genomic sequence driven by homologous recombina-
tion. Simon et al. controlled the promoter strength of the 
retrotransposon cassette and fidelity of T7 RNA polymerase 
along with the efficiency of host DNA repair machinery to 
improve the editing frequency. However, the short muta-
tion range and limited number of multiple point mutations 
as well as damaged repair machinery prevents successful 
continuous evolution.

CRISPR guided: EvolvR, CREATE, CasPER

As a navigator of the CRISPR-Cas9 complex, guide RNA 
designates the target loci based on sequence homology, 
which confers orthogonality to CRISPR-based mutagenesis 
tools. A mutagenesis system named as EvolvR utilizes a 
fusion protein which consists of a nicking variant of Cas9 
(nCas9) and error-prone DNA polymerase I (Fig. 2d, left) 
[31]. nCas9 guided by gRNA forms a nick on targeted loci 
where coupled DNA polymerase synthesizes a new strand 
of up to 200 bp with low fidelity and cleaves the displaced 
strand. Halperin et al. tuned each component to enhance 
the mutation rate and range and minimize off-target effects. 
They aimed to alleviate the affinity of nCas9 with DNA to 
promote mutagenic sliding of Pol I while introducing a triple 
combination of fidelity-reducing mutations on Pol I. The 
processivity of Pol I is also modified to expand the muta-
tion window. Finally, the coding sequence of EvolvR is opti-
mized to fit the codon usage and remove innate strong RBS 
to diminish off-target mutations. In addition, combinatorial 
mutagenesis within a single target gene and multiplexed tar-
geting on distant genes can use multiple targeting sequences. 
Considering the average size of the gene, however, the tun-
able window of EvolvR requires the design and use of sev-
eral programmed gRNAs simultaneously. Moreover, non-
targeted nickase activity also shows a risk of unintended 
genomic modification.

Another CRISPR-based mutagenesis system coupled with 
in vitro mutagenesis named as CRISPR-enabled trackable 
genome engineering (CREATE) was introduced by Garst 
et al. [28]. CREATE employs homologous repair to integrate 
a mutation pool by generating site-specific DSBs by pro-
grammed gRNA and Cas9 in Escherichia coli. As reported

previously, a DSB dramatically increases the efficiency 
of HR by at least two orders of magnitude [76, 83]. They 
support a web tool for the automated design of a CREATE 
cassette which serves as a guiding sequence for targeting, 
template used in HR, and barcode for tracking. However, 
the toxicity arising from the DSB decreases transformation 

efficiency, limiting the expandability of library construction 
and stability of the barcode in plasmids and restricting the 
tracking of genotype–phenotype relationships. Ronda et al. 
introduced another CRISPR-based multiplexed genome 
engineering method called CRISPR/Cas9 and λ Red recom-
bineering-based MAGE (CRMAGE) [74]. This technology 

1 3Journal of Industrial Microbiology & Biotechnology (2019) 46:1313–1326

utilized two curable plasmids encoding Cas9, λ Red protein, 
and target-specific sgRNA under the control of inducible 
promoters. They also contained self-eliminating genetic 
circuit for subsequent rounds and efficiency-enhancing ele-
ments such as RecX and dam methyltransferase that confers 
transient MutS and RecA- phenotypes. The CRMAGE sys-
tem showed higher efficiency compared to the traditional 
MAGE and was provided with a web-based tool to facilitate 
the design of an experiment. However, the incomplete kill-
ing of non-engineered, wild-type cells remains a challenge. 
Jakočiūnas et al. developed Cas9-mediated Protein Evolution 
Reaction (CasPER) which enables the integration of large 
mutant fragments into genomic loci (Fig. 2d, right). CasPER 
exploits the specific targeting ability of CRISPR and DSB-
induced HR and an error-containing target gene generated 
by five consecutive ep-PCR [35].

Mutator plasmid

Badran and Liu developed a mutator plasmid as an induc-
ible episomal vector, which prevents redundant replication 
maintenance mechanisms such as proofreading, mismatch 
repair, and base selection (Fig. 2e) [3]. By combining sev-
eral genes representing the mutator phenotype, plasmids 
with diverse mutational spectra were constructed. Among 
them, MP6 showed the highest mutation rate and unbiased 
mutation spectrum along with a very large dynamic range. 
The mutagenic performance of the random mutagenic plas-
mid was shown to be sustainable in phage-assisted continu-
ous evolution in a subsequent study [2]. Although partially 
blocked DNA repair machinery shows compromised viabil-
ity, the mutation rate does not exceed the error threshold of 
essential genes [9, 45].

Tools and systems for screening 
and selection

Directed evolution and evolutionary engineering have ena-
bled the production of numerous strains to form new chemi-
cal bonds, such as carbon–silicon bonding that has never 
been observed in nature [44], improve the solubilities of 
heterologous proteins [53, 93], and increase tolerance to 
chemicals [5, 11, 41, 47]. The previous studies using these 
applications have already been reviewed [14, 63]. Thus, 
here, we focus on artificial selection and screening for chem-
ical high-producing cells using synthetic genetic devices 
consisting of a biosensor including transcription factor or 
RNA-based regulatory elements and selectable marker or 
fluorescence reporters with fluidic devices. It is important 
to create genetic diversity and effectively screen variants 
showing a desired phenotype (typically chemical high-
producer) from the generated library in directed evolution 

and adaptive laboratory evolution [18, 90]. As a promising 
industrial strain, E. coli can be used with maximum library 
sizes of up to  1010; this value is limited by transformation 
efficiency [33, 42, 91]. However, because the phenotypes 
are typically inconspicuous, it is difficult to effectively iden-
tify the improved strain with the desired phenotype [72]. In 
the conventional screening methods, individual strains are 
separated, and their productivities are measured directly by 
high-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatogra-
phy, and microtiter plates. However, the analytical methods 
are less likely to detect meaningful positive mutants in the 
library, because the number of variants tested per experi-
ment is generally lower than  104, which is time-consuming 
and labor-intensive for assessing library spaces [51, 52, 97]. 
Therefore, high-throughput screening methods are required 
to alleviate the limitations and cover the entire library 
size to effectively screen for positive mutants [39]. High-
throughput screening of strains with phenotypes such as high 
production of target metabolites has become possible with 
the introduction of a screening and selection system based 
on a genetically encoded biosensor including a riboswitch 
and transcription factor (Fig. 3a, Table 2) [57]. A synthetic 
genetic device for high-throughput screening consists of a 
specific upstream ligand-responsive biosensor and down-
stream expression module [51]. An antibiotic-resistant gene, 
essential gene, or gene encoding a fluorescent protein is 
mainly used as an expression module. When a biosensor spe-
cifically binds to a cognate ligand, conformational changes 
occur in response to the intracellular ligand concentration, 
and expression of the downstream module is regulated at the 
transcriptional or translational levels [19, 21, 27, 50].

First, we summarize recent studies that have used growth-
coupled selection to obtain a strain with an improved target 
metabolite productivity and review recent studies of cell 
sorting and screening through fluorescence signal detection 
based on microfluidics in the following section (Fig. 3b).

Genetic devices and circuits for artificial screening 
selection

Transcription factor‑based selection tools

Transcription factors (TFs) have been reported to regulate 
expression in response to a variety of metabolites including 
amino acids, flavonoids, and cofactors [60, 68]. Natural TFs-
cognate promoter sets were used as detectors, or artificial 
promoters that responded to the desired metabolites were 
identified by proteomics analysis [54]. Selection devices 
for regulating the expression of antibiotics-resistance genes 
using TFs as a sensor protein that responds to target metabo-
lites have been constructed and applied [24, 77, 98, 101]. A 
synthetic selection device responding to the 3-hydroxypropi-
onic acid concentration was constructed to control tetA gene

strains producing high levels of chemicals as the major pop-
ulation, while the minor population which could not produce 
sufficient amounts of metabolites was eliminated by antibi-
otic selection. In this research, the free fatty acid-responsive 
transcription factor FadR and synthetic promoter PAR and 
tyrosine-responsive TF TyrR with the tyrosine-activated pro-
moter, PT1 or PT2, were utilized to maintain the quality of 
the population for a and b production, respectively [97]. By 
expanding the scope of evolutionary metabolic engineering 
to the whole biosynthesis process of metabolites, 18 endog-
enous loci in E. coli were simultaneously mutagenized by 
multiplex automated genomic engineering within regula-
tory and coding sequences to construct a mutational library. 
Expression of the membrane protein TolC was regulated by 
a natural transcription factor, TtgR, and sensing by the  Pttga 
promoter depends on the naringenin concentration. Tog-
gling positive and negative selection applied to libraries can 
enrich higher-producing cells and reduce the possibility that 
cheater cells dominate the population [68]. Modifications 
of an allosteric transcription factor are based on a computa-
tional strategy for altering effector specificity of the protein. 
In this study, the repressor protein LacI was re-engineered 
to respond to fucose, gentiobiose, lactitol, and sucralose 
[85]. In addition to the allostery, the stability of proteins 
can be used to engineer biosensors. Jester et al. engineered 
steroid biosensors using dimeric ligand-binding domains, 
the stability of which can be controlled by the ligand [40]. 
By fusing each dimeric domain to a DNA-binding domain 
and a transcriptional activation domain, a full transcriptional 
activator was able to be reconstituted only in the presence of 
two ligands that bind and stabilize the dimeric domains. The 
researchers further engineered the heterodimerization and 
selectivity of the sensor through directed evolution. Selected 
mutants were subsequently analyzed by NGS, elucidating 
the spectrum of mutations that allowed improved sensor 
performance.

Riboswitch‑based selection tools

The riboswitch is a cis-regulatory RNA element that con-
sists of an aptamer domain that specifically binds small mol-
ecules and an expression platform that regulates downstream 
gene expression by causing a conformational change upon 
ligand binding to the aptamer [39]. The riboswitches used 
for directed evolution function mainly at two levels: tran-
scriptional and translational. Forming the rho-independent 
transcription terminator, which regulates gene expression at 
the transcription level leading to premature transcription ter-
mination and sequestering or releasing the ribosome-binding 
site (RBS), can control gene expression at the translational 
level [12]. Likes TFs, numerous RNA-based biosensors are 
known to exist in nature. Furthermore, natural detector ele-
ments were identified by methods such as NGS and Par-
allel Analysis of RNA Conformations Exposed to Ligand 
binding (PARCEL) [17, 84]. High-throughput screening 
of the riboregulator can control transcription termination 
in response to a specific metabolite concentration by com-
bining the transcription start site sequencing and transcrip-
tion termination site sequencing method based on NGS 
[17]. Furthermore, an experimental strategy for identifying 
RNA aptamers in vitro known as PARCEL in the transcrip-
tomes revealed 58 novel RNA aptamers in both untranslated 
regions and coding sequences [84]. A natural riboswitch 
was engineered with specificity for non-natural small mol-
ecules and no response to the original ligand [20]. For a 
suitable RNA-based detector that specifically responds to 
target biochemicals that do not exist in nature, riboswitch 
binding to the desired chemical can be artificially prepared 
using an in vitro selection method known as systematic evo-
lution of ligands by exponential enrichment [36, 37, 100]. 
The riboswitch-based biosensor was successfully applied 
for growth-coupled selection [61, 88, 89]. For example, 
a riboselector as a synthetic RNA device that specifically 
reacts with l-lysine and l-tryptophan to express the tetracy-
cline resistance gene was constructed. The riboselector con-
ferred a fitness advantage to strains with high performance 
by expressing tetracycline resistance. Particularly, selection 
of the ppc promoter library to obtain the high-producing 
strain of l-lysine resulted in successful enrichment of the 
top 3 improved strains to 75% of the population in only four 
rounds of enrichment cycles [99]. In addition to the ribos-
witch, metabolite-responsive ribozymes have been exploited 
to select metabolite high producers. For example, a glmS 
ribozyme, which responds to the glucosamine 6-phosphate 
concentration, was combined with the 3′-untranslated region 
of the cytosine deaminase, FCY1, in S. cerevisiae to con-
struct a synthetic suicide riboswitch to screen for an N-acetyl 
glucosamine-overproducing S. cerevisiae strain. A glu-
tamine–fructose-6-phosphate transaminase mutant library 
and haloacid dehalogenase-like phosphatases library were

resulting in the N-acetyl glucosamine overproducer [49].

High‑throughput screening with fluidic systems

High-throughput screening, in which positive strains domi-
nate following library selection, has been widely used for 
directed evolution, as it is possible to exploit selectable 
markers and appropriate selection pressures without addi-
tional equipment. However, cheater cells adapted to resist-
ance under the selection pressure may be selected rather than 
positive mutants with the desired phenotype, which are not 
selected. Counterfeit transcription, such as a mutation in a 
promoter expressing a metabolic sensor or selectable marker 
in an antibiotic resistance gene, may have growth advantages 
under the selection pressure regardless of production of the 
desired metabolite. As a result, cheater cells dominate the 
population [72]. In addition, to enrich the positive strain, 
labor-intensive and long-term serial culture is required. 
Furthermore, artificial selection cannot confirm the target 
metabolite production ability at the individual cell level in 
real time [19]. Therefore, genetically encoded biosensors 
were constructed by connecting expression of the fluores-
cence markers GFP and RFP to the target metabolite con-
centration; these biosensors have been applied with various 
types of analysis equipment such as microfluidics devices 
and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) instruments 
[38, 92]. FACS can be used in combination with geneti-
cally encoded biosensors to screen mutant enzymes with 
increased product selectivity and activity. For example, a 
caffeine demethylase library containing  106–107 variants 

was screened in a few hours through FACS using fluores-
cence from a ribozyme-based biosensor as a readout. A 
screened variant showed 22- and 33-fold higher selectivity 
and activity, respectively, compared to the parental strain. 
Modular assembly of input domain (aptamer) and output 
domain (ribozyme) of the biosensors can create synthetic 
RNA switches that will be applied to various metabolic path-
ways [56]. Furthermore, FACS was also utilized to select 
variants with increased target metabolite production. For 
example, FACS was coupled with a biosensor to select thre-
onine high producers [54]. A threonine biosensor was devel-
oped by placing a fluorescent protein gene under the con-
trol of a threonine-responsive promoter cysJHp. A mutant 
library containing 2 × 107 mutants was constructed based on 
an industrial threonine producer strain ThrH(pTZL2). The 
mutant library was screened using FACS and the threonine 
biosensor within 1 week and 465 mutants were selected. 
Forty-four strains sorted from the library showed higher 
threonine productivities compared to the parental strain, 
and the highest mutant produced approximately 18% higher 
levels of threonine [54]. In addition to FACS, a microfluidics 
system was applied for the screening of high-performance 
cells. The microfluidic static droplet array can trap a sin-
gle E. coli cell in a droplet in assigned wells. A tryptophan 
riboswitch-based biosensor linked to the fluorescence pro-
tein was constructed and tryptophan overproduction strains 
were collected by detecting the output signals with the 
static droplet array system [38]. Screening that relies on the 
intracellular concentration of a substance using biosensor 
neglects the extracellular content. For secreted products, it 
is difficult to screen for true-positive strains with a system

that detects only intracellular concentrations, and obtaining 
false-positives is very likely. This resulted in a reduced prob-
ability of screening of true-positive strains that produce and 
secrete more product and increased probability of screening 
of false-positive strains that accumulate more products. To 
evaluate extracellular concentrations, screening with a drop-
let compartment is necessary. A single cell or cells required 
for co-culture were compartmented into a single droplet, 
and then incubated for fluorescence-based screening to 
ensure true-positive strain screening including extracellular 
content. One study conducted library screening of innately 
fluorescent riboflavin-producing strains. Single-cell FACS 
and droplet-based FACS screening were conducted to dem-
onstrate that the extracellular concentration represents total 
production rather than the intracellular concentration. The 
results showed that screening based on extracellular concen-
trations was more effective for isolating strains with higher 
total production [92].

Systems for continuous evolution

Natural evolution occurs continuously: genetic diversity is 
generated, selective pressure is applied, and adapted off-
spring reproduce. This cycle repeats indefinitely. In contrast, 
many evolutionary engineering techniques involve frequent 
intervention at each step of evolution. This requirement for 
intermittent handling by a researcher limits the efficiency, 
multiplexity, and scalability of evolutionary engineering. 
Therefore, researchers have attempted to conduct artifi-
cial continuous evolution which operates autonomously 
with minimal intervention [16]. The most critical issue for 
establishing continuous evolution would be how to control 
mutagenesis to generate sufficient genetic diversity at the 
genetic level while maintaining host cell stability. To address 
this challenge, there have been several attempts to develop 
genetic circuits for regulating mutagenesis or mutating only 
desired genetic loci.

First,  synthetic  genetic  circuits  enabled  controlled 
mutagenesis in response to the phenotype of interest. In this 
approach, the expression of mutagenic genes is repressed 
after achieving the desired phenotype in a cell through the 
accumulation of sufficient mutations. For example, metab-
olite-responsive promoters controlled the expression of 
an error-prone DNA polymerase subunit to evolve mutant 
strains with improved metabolite productivity such as tyros-
ine and lycopene [13]. In another example, an engineered 
riboswitch responsive to changes in pH was utilized to con-
trol the expression of an integrase [65]. The pH-dependent 
expression of the integrase, in turn, controlled the expression 
of a mutagenic gene. Mutant strains that maintained intra-
cellular pH at a neutral value or in a low pH environment 

deactivated mutagenic gene expression and stopped further 
mutagenesis.

Next, mutagenesis can be focused to desired genetic loci 
to minimize any undesired non-specific mutations that may 
lead to serious growth retardation or even elimination of 
the host cell. These strategies are explained in Sects. 2.1, 
2.2, and 2.3. The target gene(s) was cloned in a specific 
plasmid or locus with specialized elements in the OrthoRep 
[70] or using the retrotransposon method [15], respectively. 
These methods mutated the cloned “cargo” efficiently, but 
background mutagenesis was maintained at a low level. In 
contrast, EvolvR [31] enabled targeted mutagenesis at any 
locus in the genome by designing gRNAs for target genes. 
However, this method has a relatively short mutagenesis 
window (~ 350 nucleotides) compared to other methods. 
Another well-known pioneering strategy is using viral repli-
cation to propagate the evolved mutants. The phage-assisted 
continuous evolution (PACE) [23] system utilized the M13 
bacteriophage genome as a vector for target genes. In a con-
tinuous bioreactor, E. coli cells are used to mutate the target 
gene, and mutants that activate the expression of a phage 
coat protein are packed in an M13 bacteriophage virion. This 
released virion infects fresh E. coli cells to continue the next 
round of mutagenesis and selection. Phage-assisted continu-
ous evolution has been utilized to evolve various proteins 
including TALEN [34], insecticidal toxin [2], aminoacyl-
tRNA synthetase [8], RNA polymerase [67], protease [64], 
antibody [93], and Cas9 [32].

In addition to mutagenesis methods, a continuous cul-
turing  apparatus  was  fabricated  to  support  continuous 
evolution. Evolutionary engineering requires a continuous 
culturing system that allows for a multiplexed experiment 
with highly controlled culture parameters. However, the 
parameters in batch culture cannot be precisely controlled, 
while current continuous culture systems are not suitable for 
parallelized cultures. Recently, a framework for continuous 
culture known as eVOLVER was reported [94]. This system 
measures various culture parameters such as optical density 
or temperature in real time and enables automated control 
of the parameters. Moreover, a high-throughput evolution 
study using eVOLVER was conducted for 468 continuous 
cultures, at a level that cannot be achieved using previous 
methods. Because of its modularity, small size, and auto-
mated nature, multiplexed evolutionary engineering can be 
performed more easily using this platform.

molecules and microorganisms for useful applications.

mutagenesis and screening. In this progression, synthetic 
biology has provided a theoretical and experimental founda-
tion to create synthetic genetic circuits. In addition, micro-
fluidic and millifluidic systems have assisted in cultivation 
and screening in a high-throughput manner. Furthermore, 
previously discrete steps in evolutionary engineering can 
now be merged, allowing for continuous directed evolution 
without intervention by researchers. Even with this signifi-
cant progress, some challenges remain. The size of genetic 
cargo that can be mutated should be larger than the current 
size limit (~ 20 kb) to evolve large genetic constructs such as 
biosynthetic gene clusters for secondary metabolites. Uni-
versal methods that can be applied to both prokaryotes and 
eukaryotes are needed for a wide variety of applications. 
For example, microbial consortium consisting of prokaryotic 
and eukaryotic cells can be engineered as a whole using 
such universal method. Finally, evolved genes, pathways, 
and strains from initial rounds of continuous evolution can 
be recombined with each other during the evolution process 
to provide an improved mutant pool for the next round of 
evolution which will eventually facilitate the identification 
of superior mutants in a limited timeframe.
