Abstract: Enzymes underpin the processes required for most biotransformations. However, natural
enzymes are often not optimal for biotechnological uses and must be engineered for improved
activity, speciﬁcity and stability. A rich and growing variety of wet-lab methods have been developed
by researchers over decades to accomplish this goal. In this review such methods and their speciﬁc
attributes are examined.

Keywords: directed evolution; enzyme engineering; protein engineering; high throughput screening

1. Introduction

Enzymes catalyze all the fundamental transformations required to convert matter
and energy into living systems. Society has beneﬁted profusely from adaptation of pre-
existing enzymes for industrial, research and medical uses [1–6]. However, pre-existing
enzymes are often not optimal for industrial applications due to temperature, pH and
solvent stability, as well as substrate speciﬁcity and activity limitations [7–10].

To overcome these limitations, researchers have been developing methods to replicate
evolutionary processes to enable improvement of enzymes’ properties as required. These
methods constitute a critical toolbox, whose importance for public welfare was recently
recognized by the awarding of the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2018 to Frances Arnold, and
are reviewed in this article.

2. Generation of Diversity to Explore Sequence Space

The ﬁrst step for any enzyme evolution campaign is to create a library of mutants of
the target enzyme. These mutants sample sequence space in which it is hoped a satisfactory
solution will be present, which will be uncovered by the process employed for screening.
Libraries can broadly be of two types, targeted or random.

Targeted libraries mutagenize only a region of interest or speciﬁc amino acid positions
of the gene, to increase the odds of ﬁnding a desirable mutant. The region of interest may
be identiﬁed based on a crystal structure or homology model which can be used to infer
amino acid positions important for substrate binding or catalysis. Targeted libraries are
of particular interest when seeking to improve properties which are disproportionately
determined by a few positions, such as substrate speciﬁcity. Targeted libraries can be
constructed by using site directed mutagenesis using oligos with degenerate codons like
nnk or nns at the site of interest [11–13]. An attractive alternative to degenerate codons are
Trimer codon carrying oligos, which use an equimolar mix of trimeric phosphoramidates
codingfor optimal codons (usually for E. coli) for 19 or 20 amino acids [14]. This avoids
skewed representations or rare codons or stop codons. Such Trimer phosphoramidite mixes
can also be ordered customized from certain vendors such as IDT. Another option is to
have the entire library constructed from custom vendors like Twist or Genscript.

Random libraries, in contrast, target the whole gene of interest and are more relevant
when seeking to improve globally determined properties like thermal stability or where
detailed information about the enzyme of interest is not available. Such libraries can be
made easily using traditional error prone PCR [15]. One shortcoming of error prone PCR
is that as a given codon will most likely have only one mutation, a given amino acid can

only be mutagenized to a few others rather than all 19 other possibilities. For instance,
a wild type GGT codon is highly unlikely to yield an ATG or TTT codon using random
mutagenesis as more than one mutation would be required in the same codon. Under
such circumstances, custom DNA library vendors can provide a “scanning” library which
contains all 20 amino acids at each position, one mutation at a time, which might be
preferable to in-house construction. Such libraries can then be combinatorially shufﬂed to
yield a library with a greater sampling of the mutational space.

Other possibilities and variations for library generation include mutagenic strains for
continuous mutagenesis [16,17], shufﬂing of multiple single mutants to create synergisti-
cally improved combined mutations [18].

3. Library Screening Methods

Once the library is designed and synthesized, it must then be screened to identify
mutants with desired properties. The ﬁrst step, of course, is to express the library and
create a pool of protein mutants for an assay (the phenotype), each of which must retain a
traceable connection to the gene mutant (the genotype) from which it was derived. This is
because only the gene can be ampliﬁed and sequenced and is therefore required to enable
recovery and identiﬁcation of the useful protein mutant.

This review classiﬁes screening methods into two broad categories: those based
on optical signal detection and those based on survival, retrieval or growth advantages
conferred on the host by the mutant enzyme. The former is generally more quantitative
but requires more instrumentation as well as the establishment of an optical assay, while
the latter is generally simpler to implement but is more qualitative or semi-quantitative.
Optical methods have been further classiﬁed into micro scale vs. macro scale methods.
Within each category, there are many different approaches, which are described in more
detail below.

3.1. Optical Methods
3.1.1. Optical Methods > Micro-Scale Methods

All other factors being equal, it is generally preferable to adopt a screening method
which uses a small reaction scale, as this enables lower reagent costs as well as the option
of screening large numbers to ﬁnd rare high performing mutants. The use of emulsions
to generate isolated picoliter volume droplets, each acting as an independent reactor, has
gained popularity since this technology was ﬁrst described by Tawﬁk and Grifﬁths [19].
They used an emulsiﬁed in vitro transcription translation (IVTT) mix containing a DNA
template coding for HaeIII methylase followed by a HaeIII site and thereafter a biotin
moiety. Only a gene coding for a functional HaeIII methylase would methylate its site
and prevent subsequent restriction by HaeIII restriction endonuclease, thereby enabling
pulldown via the biotin moiety.

Optical Methods > Micro Scale Methods > FACS Based Double Emulsion Methods

Subsequently, other researchers have introduced many further reﬁnements, such as
the use of ﬂuorogenic substrates, the encapsulation of whole cells expressing enzyme
mutants (which allows for enzyme buffers other than those needed for IVTT—a limitation
of the original paper mentioned above), and the use of water-in-oil-in-water “double
emulsions”, whose aqueous outer phase allows for FACS (Fluorescence Activated Cell
Sorting) sorting, thus enabling rapid, quantitative isolation of desirable mutants from
libraries of millions and more. Bernath et al. demonstrated that heterogenous bulk double
emulsions could be sorted on FACS and lead to enrichment of the correct moiety [20]. Later,
Mastrobattista et al. used in vitro translation of a mixture of mutant genes along with a
ﬂuorigenic substrate in water-in-oil emulsion, followed by double emulsiﬁcation, to create
a continuous aqueous phase, followed by FACS sorting of these double emulsions to evolve
β-galactosidase activity in Ebg, a protein of unknown activity [21]. Around the same time,
Aharoni et al. used a library of >107 E. coli cells expressing mutants of serum paraoxonase

Molecules 2021, 26, 5599

(PON1) encapsulated in a double emulsion and sorted by FACS to discover a variant with
100× improved activity [22]. The double-emulsion followed by FACS approach has become
progressively popular and technologically sophisticated (see schematic in Figure 1A), with
microﬂuidic systems capable of generating uniform monodisperse droplets, and numerous
applications to different enzymes have been demonstrated [23–26].

Optical Methods > Micro Scale Methods > Water-in-Oil Emulsion Sorting Methods

More recently, researchers have demonstrated the construction of microﬂuidic devices
which allow Fluorescence Activated Droplet Sorting (FADS) using single (water-in-oil)
emulsions (see Figure 1B for an example). Such devices allow for direct sorting of water-
in-oil emulsions but generally have to be constructed in-house and may not match the
sorting rate as well as the variety of ﬂuorescence options available with commercial FACS
instruments used with water-in-oil-in-water double emulsions. Ahn and Kerbage ﬁrst
demonstrated a microﬂuidic device able to sort water in oil emulsions [27]. Baret et al. [28]
later demonstrated a device able to sort water in oil droplets at upto 2000 Hz, which could
sort droplets containing β-galactosidase containing cells from an excess of droplets without
such activity. Agresti and co-workers [29] used a device which could sort water-in-oil
droplets containing yeast cells displaying variants of Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP). Based
on the intensity of ﬂuorescence of HRP turnover products, they successfully evolved
signiﬁcantly faster variants. Other groups have also demonstrated the use of such devices
to evolve a variety of enzymes [30–33]. Interestingly, Gielen et al. [34] have demonstrated
an absorbance based FADS device instead of the more common ﬂuorescence readout. These
methods now routinely allow for the quantitative sorting of well over 107 variants.

One limitation of the above-described emulsion methods is the inability to add or
wash away reagents, limiting the read-out to cases where one-step ﬂuorescent assays
are available. Recent work has demonstrated the addition of reagents at a later stage by
controlled merger of droplets. For instance, Holstein et al. [35] recently demonstrated the
selection of Savinase protease using a sophisticated microﬂuidic emulsion device capable
of providing new reagents as required by controlled droplet merger. Other examples of
devices capable of adding new reagents by droplet merger are reviewed by Weng and
Spoonamore [36]; however, widespread use of such devices for enzyme evolution is still
some distance away.

Optical Methods > Micro Scale Methods > Matrix Capture Followed by FACS

Other workers have developed FACS methods which allow for multiple steps of
addition of new reagents and washing before assay. These methods use different matrices,
such as Streptavidin beads or agarose, to capture genes and their cognate proteins on or
in the same bead, followed by a ﬂuorescent assay whose outcome is also capture locally,
allowing for genotype-phenotype linkage followed by sorting. For example, Grifﬁths
and Tawﬁk [37] developed a multistep method which uses Streptavidin coated beads
to successively capture a gene, then its cognate protein (in emulsion via biotinylated
antibodies), and ﬁnally a substrate of the said protein, whose turnover can be detected
using ﬂuorescent antibodies followed by FACS. This method has been applied by other
researchers to different enzymes [38,39]. Other researchers have used inducible gelling
agents like agarose to serve the same purpose (see schematic in Figure 1C) [40,41].

Optical Methods > Micro Scale Methods > Well Arrays Combined with Microscopy

An alternative format to emulsions is the use of microwell or microcapillary arrays.
Like emulsions, these arrays physically retain the genotype and phenotype. Instead of a
FACS instrument, however, a microscope is used to image the array. Unlike emulsions,
these arrays can be repeatedly imaged to extract kinetic information; however, selective
recovery is less convenient than with emulsions. Cochran’s group demonstrated a mi-
crocapillary array with millions of individual capillaries, which stochastically captures
individual yeast cells displaying protein mutants, which turn over a ﬂuorescent substrate.

Molecules 2021, 26, 5599

After assay, live cells are recovered by using a laser pulse focused on the correct capillary
which expels the contents thereof (Figure 1D). The authors demonstrated the evolution of
alkaline phosphatase which is less inhibited by its phosphate by-product [42,43]. Similarly,
Zhang et al. have shown the use of a femtoliter array combined with a microcapillary for
selective recovery of genes expressing improved alkaline phosphatase [44].

Optical Methods > Micro Scale Methods > Direct FACS Sorting of Cells

A simpler option, if available, is to dispense with emulsions and directly sort intact
cells. This requires ensuring that the ﬂuorescent signal generated by the enzyme remain
associated with the cell carrying the cognate gene. Broadly speaking, there are three
types of mechanisms in the literature to enable this to happen: (1) Having a surface
exposed enzyme whose ﬂuorescent product is retained on the cell surface via covalent
or non-covalent methods, (2) an intracellular enzyme with ﬂuorogenic product which is
unable to diffuse out of the cell, and (3) a more sophisticated mechanism using ﬂuorescent
proteins driven by transcription factors responsive to speciﬁc ligands to detect the activity
of enzymes which produce (or degrade) said ligands.

Paradigm 1 is exempliﬁed by Olsen et al., who used the adsorption of a positively
charged FRET (Forster Resonance Energy Transfer) substrate on the negatively charged
cell surface to isolate, using FACS, an OmpT outer membrane protease mutant with
altered speciﬁcity [45]. The same group later reported other examples [46–48] of this
approach. Pitzler et al. [49] reported an interesting variation wherein the presence of a
hydrolase-glucose oxidase coupled activity leads to radical formation and polymerization
of a ﬂuorescent monomer on the surface of E. coli, leading to a “fur-shell” structure which
can be FACS sorted. This method was then utilized for phytase evolution.

The Liu lab demonstrated a more generally adaptable example of this class by display-
ing a Sortase A library on the cell surface of yeast S. cerevisiae, followed by the exogenous
attachment of a Sortase A acceptor peptide. Thereafter, a biotinylated donor peptide was
added to the yeast cell suspension to enable fast Sortase A variants to conjugate it to
the above-mentioned acceptor peptide. Staining of the donor peptide with Streptavidin-
phycoerythrin allowed for more active variants to be isolated by FACS (see schematic in
Figure 1E) [50,51].

The second approach is used for intracellular enzymes whose substrates can be
expressed in vivo or provided externally and the products of which remain within the
cell for FACS sorting, as exempliﬁed by Aharoni et al. [52] and Yang et al. [53]. However,
this method is dependent on the presence of a cell permeable substrate and impermeable
product, which is rarely available.

The third concept starts by adapting an existing analyte sensitive transcription factor
or ﬂuorescent reporter protein, or by engineering an existing biosensor [54] to be speciﬁc for
the analyte of interest. This in vivo transcription factor then provides a ﬂuorescent signal
proportional to the amount of the analyte present by transcribing a ﬂuorescent protein
and can be used to monitor the activity of a biosynthetic enzyme which produces the
analyte of interest. This concept has been recently demonstrated by Della Corte et al. [55],
among others. Meister et al. [56] use a variation which involves the in vivo expression of
a ﬂuorescent protein fused to an aggregation inducing peptide separated by a protease
site. Cleavage of the non-standard protease site by a suitable mutant coxsackievirus 3C
protease allows the reporter to remain soluble, thus enabling detection by FACS. In an
interesting variation of this theme, Michener and Smolke [57] have demonstrated the use
of analyte responsive RNA switches linked to GFP mRNA translation in yeast to enable
the detection of the product theophylline, which was then exploited to evolve improved
variants of caffeine demethylase. Other groups have also made use of this strategy to
evolve or discover enzymes capable of catalyzing desired reactions [58,59].

An important technical challenge with micro scale methods is DNA retrieval from
single sorted cells. As the mutant library is generally present on a multi-copy plasmid,
there are multiple copies of each mutant gene per cell. Some researchers report direct

Molecules 2021, 26, 5599

transformation of recovered DNA into high efﬁciency electrocompetent cells [25,30,34]. In
some cases, the host cells are still viable after sorting and can be directly placed in suitable
medium for growth [50]. PCR to recover the mutant gene sequence is another common
approach [44] but may require multiple nested PCRs and/or gel puriﬁcation to retrieve the
desired product.

In sum, micro-scale optical methods have shown excellent potential for enzyme evolu-

tion with very high throughput. Some representative schematics are shown in Figure 1.

3.1.2. Optical Methods > Macro-Scale Methods

In some cases where technical requirements do not allow for convenient adoption
of the micro-scale methods listed above, or where the number of mutants to be screened
is lower, it might be more expeditious to use macro-scale (i.e., naked-eye visible reaction
scales) methods such as screening in 96 or 384 wells or directly on culture plates. These
methods require relatively simpler instrumentation and allow a more ﬂexible assay at the
cost of lower throughput. Some common formats are described below.

Optical Methods > Macro Scale Methods > Well Plate-Based Methods

96/384 plate-based screening methods are popular and accessible due to their sim-
plicity and quantitative read-out. Broadly, the mutant library is transformed into E. coli
and plated on a culture plate. Individual colonies are then inoculated into a 96 well plate
(higher density plates generally give poor E. coli growth due to aeration issues) and grown
in a plate shaker, followed by induction, lysis if needed and then assayed with an optical
read-out such as ﬂuorescence or absorbance to indicate activity (see Figure 2A) [60–63].
One issue that must be addressed with plate-based formats is whether the cells need to

Molecules 2021, 26, 5599

6 of 14

be lysed, as in the case of intracellular enzymes and non-permeable substrates, which is
usually the case. In cases where lysis is needed, options such as a water-bath sonicator
or the use of permeabilizing reagents such as detergents (BugBuster or SoluLyse etc.) or
anti-microbial peptides (e.g., Cecropin A, polymyxin B etc.), enzymes such as lysozyme,
physical processes like freeze–thaw cycles, and autolysis strains such as XJb or combi-
nations thereof are available [64]. The presence of endogenous enzymes from the cell
lysate can interfere with the expressed enzyme assay. We found that simple dilution could
sometimes be used to ameliorate this interference [61]. If this does not work, puriﬁcation
of the expressed protein using afﬁnity tags may be required. Tags such as GFP or split
GFP may also be used to normalize the amount of expressed protein to obtain a speciﬁc
activity value, which helps resolve confounding factors such as differential expression
levels [65,66]. High density plates with 1536 or more wells, and robotic instrumentation
for liquid handling or colony picking are highly useful for well-plate based screening;
however, with higher density than 96 wells, poor culture aeration becomes a limiting factor
(personal observation).

Optical Methods > Macro Scale Methods > Culture Plate Based Screening

A simpler option which may be used when a qualitative read-out sufﬁces, and sub-
strate accessibility is not an issue, is culture-plate based screening. This involves growing
cell colonies on an agar plate with suitable media, followed optionally by plate replication
onto agar plates, or nitrocellulose or Durapore membranes in cases where the protein
may be toxic or a white background may be desired, and ﬁnally protein expression and
exposure to substrate under controlled conditions. Secreted enzyme mutants or a perme-
able substrate then allow for the generation of an optically distinguishable signal “halo”,
highlighting colonies expressing outstanding mutants with larger halos [67–70]. In other
cases, the signal remains in vivo, and the whole colony becomes colored or ﬂuorescent.
For instance, O’Loughlin et al. devised a screen for HIV protease mutants with altered
speciﬁcity by looking for proteases capable of cleaving a β-galactosidase protein reporter,
which results in decreased blue coloration in the presence of X-gal, a chromogenic substrate
of β-galactosidase [71]. A total of 60,000 variants were reported to have been screened in a
single round, highlighting the high throughput and ease of process of plate-based methods.
The use of dyes to highlight colonies secreting cellulases has been well attested [72,73].

Further reﬁnements can include the use of freeze-thaw, to release intracellular en-
zymes, and a “ﬁlter-sandwich” format, which allows for more complex multi-step assays
with the released enzyme [74,75]. Kermekchiev et al. [76] successfully selected a cold-
sensitive Taq polymerase from a total of 3800 mutants using a culture-plate derived ﬁlter
assay. Weiß et al. [77] used a sophisticated process to screen transaminase variants using
a plate based coupled assay, resulting in a colored colony in the presence of the desired
speciﬁcity (see Figure 2B).

In summary, culture-plate based optical screening allows for relatively high through-
put (~105–106) and simple and convenient assays, albeit at the cost of precision. How-
ever, where semi-quantitative or qualitative read-outs and moderate throughput suf-
ﬁce, optical plate-based assays are a competitive option owing to their low cost and low
equipment needs.

3.2. Survival//Retrieval Based Methods

Another common concept used for enzyme evolution is to link the desired performance
of the enzyme to survival or retrieval of the cognate cell or gene. This method, which has
multiple formats as described below, can be particularly useful under certain circumstances.

plate based optical assay. Adapted with publisher’s permission from Chua et al. [61]. (B) Plate based screening using
chromogenic substrate to identify promising mutants. Reproduced with permission from [77].

3.2.1. Survival/Retrieval Based Methods > Cell Survival Based Methods

The most direct case is when the cell is unable to survive due to a lack of essential
proteins or metabolites or due to the presence of toxic agents in the milieu. The assay is
arranged in such a way that only the desired mutant of interest can relieve this blockage
to growth and thus selectively allow for survival of only the cell carrying the desired
enzyme variant (see schematic in Figure 3A). The upside of this methods is its simplicity
and potentially very high throughput; variants are simply subjected to conditions that the
original host cannot survive, and survivors are retrieved for veriﬁcation. The drawback
is that it is not possible to link enzyme activity to cell survival in many cases, and the
simple survival/death read-out does not allow for ﬁne activity distinctions. Nonetheless,
under the right conditions, survival-based screening is unmatched in terms of speed
and convenience.

For instance, Hecky and Muller [78] evolved a thermostable variant of beta-lactamase
by intentionally destabilizing beta-lactamase with a small C terminal truncation, which
leads to decreased ampicillin resistance, expressing this in E. coli and selecting for mutants
that restore resistance, and then re-attaching the truncated amino acids. This dramatically
increased beta-lactamase thermostability as the restoration of the C terminus combined
synergistically with the stabilizing effect of the new mutations. It is easy to foresee the
same idea being applied to other essential enzymes to improve their thermostability
and/or activity.

Park et al. [79] similarly used a survival based selection process to engineer lactamase
activity into an αβ/βα metallohydrolase scaffold of glyoxalase II enzyme by modiﬁca-
tion of active site proximal loops and selection of mutants which could survive in the
presence of cefotaxime. Numerous groups have used strains with deletions of metabolic
enzymes as hosts to re-evolve the lost activity into a new protein scaffold. For instance,
Jurgens et al. [80] selected a Thermotoga maritima N(cid:48)-[(5(cid:48)-Phosphoribosyl)formimino]-
5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide isomerase (HisA) variant which could
also carry out phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerization by transforming a HisA library
into an E. coli strain with a TrpF deletion, plating the transformants on minimal media
lacking tryptophan and isolating plasmids from the survivors. Similar results have been

Molecules 2021, 26, 5599

8 of 14

demonstrated with other enzymes [81–84] with up to 106 mutants screened simply by
plating on suitable media.

A particularly interesting application of survival-based selection is the adaptation
of modiﬁed tRNA and their respective synthetases as orthogonal pairs translating amber
stop codons in a different host organism. Such a modiﬁed pair can then be used to
incorporate modiﬁed amino acids with functionality that is absent in the natural amino
acids, such as alkynes for click chemistry, phosphate groups for studying the effect of
site-speciﬁc phosphorylation, and so on [85–89]. In one illustrative example, [90] to evolve
such an orthogonal tRNA and synthetase pair, both positive and negative selections are
carried out in vivo using a toxic protein (e.g., barnase) and an antibiotic resistance protein
(e.g., β-lactamase), both of which carry an amber STOP codon. A tRNACUA library is
expressed without its cognate tRNA synthetase in an E. coli host which also carries a
barnase gene with an Amber STOP codon at a non-essential position. If a given tRNACUA
is recognized by an E. coli tRNA synthetase, it will suppress the Amber STOP codon in
barnase, leading to cell death. Thus promiscuous tRNACUAs which can interact with
E. coli synthetase will be lost. After this step, a positive selection is carried out where the
remaining tRNACUA variants are expressed in the presence of the foreign (M. jannaschii)
tRNA synthetase as well as a lactamase gene with an Amber STOP codon in a non-essential
position. A functional tRNACUA and tRNA synthetase pair will suppress the Amber
codon and permit full length lactamase protein translation, allowing for cell survival in the
presence of ampicillin, thus creating an orthogonal pair. A recent interesting application
of the survival strategy was demonstrated by Gaudelli et al. [91] who used a survival
based selection to evolve a tRNA adenine deaminase (TadA from E. coli) to work on a
DNA substrate for genome editing purposes by introducing a disabling G to A mutation in
antibiotic resistance genes and looking for TadA mutants capable of reversing the same.

Some directed evolution campaigns have used this method for negative selection, that
is, to get rid of non-speciﬁc clones which form the vast majority of most mutant libraries by
linking the said non-speciﬁc activity to transcription of a lethal protein [54] or to proteolytic
cleavage of essential E. coli proteins [71], followed by a more ﬁne grained screening of
the remaining library members for positive activity using more quantitative methods like
FACS. Such a hybrid approach leverages the best features of plate-based selection (highly
parallel but non-quantitative selection) and FACS (quantitative but serial screening).

3.2.2. Survival/Retrieval Based Methods > In Vitro DNA Retrieval Based Methods

Another class of methods which falls in the survival or retrieval-based selection cate-
gory is Compartmentalized Self-Replication (CSR). It is emulsion based like the FACS/FADS
based microdroplet methods discussed above, but instead of an optical read-out, in CSR
typically polymerase mutants expressed in E. coli are isolated in emulsion droplets along
with dNTPs and suitable primer in a suitable buffer and tasked with amplifying their own
genes, akin to PCR, under challenging conditions like high temperatures, the presence of
inhibitors like blood or mismatched primers (see Figure 3B) [92–94], or heavily modiﬁed
nucleotides [95]. Ong et al. [96] demonstrated a variant of CSR called short patch CSR
(spCSR) wherein PCR oligos amplify only a short mutagenized region of the polymerase
gene instead of the whole ORF, thus retaining variation information but avoiding the
strenuous requirement of amplifying long stretches of nucleic acid. Using spCSR, the
authors evolved a polymerase with simultaneous DNA and RNA polymerase activity as
well as reverse transcriptase activity.

A further variant is Compartmentalized Self-Tagging (CST) [97–99], in which a bi-
otinylated primer binds weakly to plasmids released after heatshock lysis from cells in
emulsion. If the cognate polymerase is able to incorporate modiﬁed nucleotides into this
primer, the strength of binding improves, allowing for robust pulldown of the relevant
plasmid onto Streptavidin beads. CST has been used for the incorporation of modiﬁed
bases such as Hexose Nucleic Acid (HNA), cyclohexenyl nucleic acids (CeNA), Locked
nucleic acids (LNA) and others.

An interesting modiﬁcation of this concept uses ribosome display to link a protein and
its cognate mRNA together, followed by compartmentalization and reverse transcription
of the mRNA by the cognate enzyme, followed by recovery.

3.2.3. Survival/Retrieval Based Methods > Phage Pulldown Retrieval Methods

In many cases, it is necessary to undertake multiple rounds to reach a level or type of
activity desired. The Liu group have developed a method called Phage Assisted Continuous
Evolution (PACE) [100] in which multiple rounds of selection are undertaken without user
intervention. Brieﬂy, M13 phages carrying mutant genes are selected on the basis of their
ability to induce transcription of the essential gene III in the host cell, enabling assembly of
viable phage particles. The produced phage particles also undergo mutagenesis owing to
the presence of a “mutagenesis plasmid” in the host E. coli, generating new diversity at each
round of host cell infection. This method was used to evolve T7 RNA polymerases [100],
Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxin [101], tRNA synthetases [102], and Cas9 with an altered
protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) recognition sequence [103] among others.

Apart from PACE, phage display is more commonly used for discovery of binding
moieties like peptides or proteins. However, phage display has also been used for enzyme
evolution in other contexts. Many different paradigms have been demonstrated, such as
selection of antibodies binding to transition state analogs, which therefore may be able to act
as catalysts or “Abzymes” [104], and selection of thermostable enzymes based on resistance
to protease cleavage [105] or polymerases based on the ability to catalyze the addition
of a biotinylated modiﬁed nucleotide onto a locally bound substrate (Figure 3C) [106].
Interestingly, similar results have also been demonstrated by ribosome display as well,
which holds the potential for much greater sequence space exploration [107–109].
Some illustrative survival/retrieval based methods are depicted in Figure 3.

4. Conclusions

From the ﬁrst attempts over 40 years ago [110] to modern methods capable of very
high throughput and quantitative readouts, enzyme evolution/screening techniques have
come a long way and are now able to screen over a billion mutants. Nonetheless, given
the immense diversity present in even small enzymes, there is a great deal of space left
to explore and, therefore, enzymes of great value left to discover. In particular, there is
room for further miniaturization to single enzyme level, which should allow a signiﬁcant
improvement in throughput and cost, much as moving from 96 well plate assays to
emulsions did. Although ribosome or mRNA display technologies might be expected to
provide this capability, at this time, these methods have yet to become widespread to the
same extent as CSR or optical emulsion sorting. It falls to today’s researchers to come up
with new solutions that can continue to improve our ability to locate these diamonds in
the rough.
