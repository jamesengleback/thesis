Synthetic biology is among the most hyped research topics this century, and in
2010 it entered its teenage years. But rather than these being a problematic
time, we’ve seen synthetic biology blossom and deliver many new technologies
and landmark achievements.

In 2020 synthetic biology turned 20 years old. It’s ﬁrst decade saw some impressive research
papers, lots of visionary thinking and unprecedented excitement, but its second decade—from
2010 to 2020—was when the hype really needed to be replaced by some real achievements. So
how has it done?

The decade got off to a great start. Looking back at 2010, the biggest synthetic biology story of
the year was the complete synthesis of a working bacterial genome by a team at the J. Craig
Venter Institute (JCVI)1. A landmark achievement that showed that DNA synthesis and DNA
assembly could be scaled to megabase size, delivering on some of the biggest ambitions from the
start of the century. However, just scaling DNA construction would not be enough to deliver the
ﬁeld’s many other ambitions. 2010 also saw the publication of ‘Five Hard Truths for Synthetic
Biology’ a critical article that examined how the lack of progress on engineering ambitions was
slowing efforts to deliver on promises of reliability, standardisation and automated design2.
These were indeed problems for the ﬁeld, and were highlighted in one of the ﬁrst synthetic
biology papers in Nature Communications which showed a robust genetic logic gate failing when
moved into different E. coli strains3. Could hard biological problems such as context, noise,
burden and cross-reactivity really be solved to allow us to engineer cells like we wire-up elec-
tronic circuits?

Well thanks to a lot of challenging technical biology and biological engineering work
undertaken by many in the ﬁeld, but especially MIT’s Chris Voigt, the answer to this was yes. In
2016 Nielsen et al., published Cello, a remarkable end-to-end computer aided design system for
logic circuit construction in E. coli4. Of all the papers in the last decade, this is probably the most
satisfying for hardcore synthetic biologists as it realises so much of the promised engineering of
biology and does so through standardisation, characterisation and automated design. It’s no
coincidence that in the years preceding this paper Voigt’s team worked tirelessly on delivering so
many other foundational papers on E. coli synthetic biology, giving us algorithmic design of
genetic parts, and professional characterisation of part libraries. While it is easy to focus on the
many big landmark achievements of synthetic biology (Fig. 1), what has really helped the ﬁeld
deliver on the hype more than anything else has been a lot of hard technical work to improve our
design and understanding of genetic parts alongside innovation and the discovery of new
technologies that let us write, build, edit and share DNA code better than ever (Fig. 2).

Indeed, looking back 10 years what is most striking is how the methods and tools have
changed for those engineering life. Many groups were still reliant on the iGEM competition for

exchanging their DNA parts. These could only be assembled
serially by BioBrick cloning, and performance data on these parts
was rarely reliable. Building a genetic construct was slow lab work
and typically resulted in failure when added into a cell. Methods
to ﬁx a DNA construct once inside a cell were severely lacking
and in high demand. It’s no surprise therefore, that synthetic
biology groups were the ﬁrst to pounce on gene editing tech-
nologies like CRISPR as they appeared in 2011 and 2012. Since
2006, George Church’s lab had been pursuing a project to mutate
every TAG stop codon to TAA in E. coli to free up a codon for an
extra amino acid5, and so unsurprisingly they were very inter-
ested in developing any technology that can precisely alter DNA
inside a cell. His group and his former postdoc published the ﬁrst
two papers in 2013 showing CRISPR being used in eukaryotic
cells and developed many further innovations of CRISPR in the
following years, including CRISPR-based gene drives. Synthetic

biology groups in California were also quick to turn CRISPR into
more than just a cutting tool, inventing the now ubiquitous dCas9
as a programmable binder of DNA to enable customisable gene
regulation6.

While there’s no doubt that CRISPR was the breakthrough of
the decade in biosciences, it’s perhaps its forerunner TALENs
(TAL-Effector Nucleases) that deserve more credit in revolutio-
nizing how synthetic biology changed in the past 10 years. The
promise of modular, programmable binding of any DNA
sequence and an in vivo gene editing method lured many towards
this new technology in 2011. But the large highly-repetitive nat-
ure of TALENs was a slap in the face for anyone used to standard
DNA cloning methods, PCR or even Gibson Assembly. If you
wanted to work with TALENs you needed to either buy a lot of
synthesised DNA, become an expert
in robot-based DNA
assembly automation, or get your hands on a Golden Gate

Fig. 2 New enabling technologies and ways of working that have accelerated the design-build-test-learn cycle of synthetic biology in the last decade.

now help accelerate each phase of the cycle.

Assembly TALEN cloning toolkit from Addgene. Fortunately for
synthetic biology, many people in the ﬁeld tried one, two, or even
all three of these things and soon began to see how much faster
DNA assembly can proceed. Golden Gate DNA Assembly now
rightly dominates the ﬁeld and the many modular cloning
(MoClo) toolkits and genetic part libraries shared via Addgene
have transformed the way people work and build upon each
other’s ﬁndings. Companies and academic institutions have set up
dedicated facilities for automated DNA cloning and perhaps most
importantly, DNA synthesis costs have fallen to the point where
ordering a custom-made gene is now often more cost-efﬁcient
than trying to clone it. Such an enabling drop in price cannot be
underestimated for how it changes people’s way of working for
the better.

The drop in cost for gene synthesis can mostly be attributed to
new methods for printing thousands of oligonucleotides in par-
allel on chips to make ‘oligo pools’ and teaming this with next
generation sequencing (NGS) as a much more cost-effective
method for validating assembled DNA. These two technologies
also opened the door to a major change in the way people worked
in synthetic biology, suddenly making it cost effective to design,
build and measure in parallel hundreds of thousands of genetic
designs in one experiment7. If you can tie the output of your
genetic design to an NGS-compatible measurement (e.g. barcoded
RNAseq) then data analysis becomes your new bottleneck, not
design and assembly as before. This has led to a major shift in the
relationship between mathematical approaches and biology in
synthetic biology over the decade. When making and testing
DNA constructs was slow and expensive in the 2000s, mathe-
matical modelling was valuable to predict successes and failures,
and to narrow down the design space. Now this approach is rarely
needed, and mathematical analysis instead ﬁnds its value in sta-
tistical analysis of large data sets and using this to learn how to
design DNA.

High-power computation also opened up new frontiers in what
can be modelled and predicted in the last 10 years. Rational
design of proteins, spearheaded by David Baker’s group, came on
leaps and bound, and ended the decade as part of gene circuitry in
living yeast cells8. The ﬁrst ever whole cell model, for Mycoplasma
genitalium, was released, enabling simulation of the effects of
hundreds of genes through a cell cycle9. This helped inform
JCVI’s project towards a minimal genome, which delivered a
further landmark in 2016 with the impressive engineering of a
bacteria with a minimized synthetic genome10.

Synthetic genomics also moved into eukaryotes with the
international Sc2.0 consortium constructing highly-modiﬁed, yet
fully-functional synthetic versions of Baker’s yeast chromo-
somes11. E. coli also ended the decade with a synthetic genome,
redesigned and constructed to remove all use of 3 of the 64
codons of the genetic code12. Such recoding enables cells to be
engineered to readily insert non-standard amino acids into pro-
teins as desired. This was pioneered by the Church lab’s
mutation-based approach that reduced E. coli to using only 63
codons earlier in the decade, demonstrating expansion of the
genetic code5. Expansion of this code was also achieved in E. coli
by addition of bases of DNA beyond just A, T, C and G.

DNA also became a way to store data, initially just in vitro via
chemical synthesis, but then also in cells via ‘molecular recorder’
genetic systems that use recombinases or CRISPR to modify DNA
as cells grow, divide and change their gene expression. Sensing
and recording in cells even went into the body, with gut bacteria
sensing and reporting on events inside mice. Engineered probiotic
bacteria were made that detect cancer in urine and others turned
them into therapies, correcting metabolic disorders and sensing
and destroying pathogens. The hottest cell-based therapies in the
pharma industry, cancer-targeting CAR-T cells, also started to be
equipped with sensing and logic devices from synthetic biology.
Sensing and logic with synthetic biology also found further
healthcare applications,
including paper-based biosensors that
could be rapidly designed to detect RNA from pathogens like
Ebola and Zika13. These sensors, along with other recent appli-
cations, were enabled by new modular ways to design complex
nucleic acid interactions, such as toehold switches, and by a new
‘cell-free’ way to do synthetic biology, using lysates from cells as
customisable and accessible alternatives to in-cell engineering14.
Healthcare has now arguably replaced metabolic engineering as
the go-to for synthetic biology applications, but that has not stopped
progress in this area too. Academic achievements include engineering
cells to ﬁx CO2 and nitrogen, and getting yeast to make opioids and
cannabinoids. Biofoundries have been established at many institutes
and can demonstrate rapid engineering of cells for biosynthesis of
dozens of different molecules15. Of course, much of the work in
using synthetic biology for metabolic engineering now happens at
companies like Amyris, Genomatica, Ginkgo and Zymergen.

Looking back on the decade, the many research landmarks and
new directions for synthetic biology are indeed very impressive,
but as synthetic biology researchers it’s the advances in enabling
technologies that excite us the most as these unlock what can

achievement of the decade that justiﬁes the hype of the ﬁeld back
in 2010, then we can look no further than the proliferation and
valuations of
the hundreds of synthetic biology companies
around the world. A multibillion dollar industry now exists that
makes chemicals, drugs, proteins, probiotics, sensors, fertilisers,
textiles, food and many other things from engineered cells. And
these are not existing companies just buying into synthetic biol-
ogy, but companies founded, led and grown by the postdocs,
PhDs and iGEM students who researched at the bench and in
most cases have worked in this ﬁeld their entire adult lives.
