## Overview
This document outlines how to contribute comments and suggested changes to this thesis.
The thesis is hosted at [**jamesengleback.xyz**](jamesengleback.xyz) and the working repository is at [**https://github.com/jamesengleback/thesis**](https://github.com/jamesengleback/thesis).
For my convenience it's being written in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) - an easy to write, interconvertible text format.
My markdown is converted to [html](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) for your browser by [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

Here are some good markdown cheatsheets:

- [https://www.markdownguide.org/](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
- [https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

I'm managing versions of this project with [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) because it lets me track suggested merges etc from multiple sources.
The complication is that anyone who wants to help will need to know how to do it.

Here is a quick guide on how to contribute changes, suggestions etc:
