## Overview
The bacterial cytochrome P450 BM3 will be the template enzyme for this engineering project. 
It was chosen because it has been extensively characterised, is practical to express and purify and has been the subject of engineering efforts to alter its substrate specificity to compounds with similar properties to some herbicides.

Wild-type [cytochrome P450 BM3](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P14779) (Cyp102A1, Uniprotkb: `P14779`) is a bacterial P450 found in *Bacillus megatarium* that contains a fused NADPH-P450 reductase domain. 
The natural substrate is unknown, but likely to be a fatty acid with chains of 12-16 carbons.
It typically hydroxylates carbons at the apolar tail of the chain at the omega -1,-2 and -3 positions.

The fused NADPH/P450 reductase domain is an uncharacteristic feature of a P450, but results in a rate of reaction faster than any other known P450 towards its preferred substrates - 17000 MS<sup>-1</sup> in the case of [arachidonic acid](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Arachidonic-acid) - a poly-unsaturated fatty acid with 20 carbon chain.
