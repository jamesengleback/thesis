1.1 Need for more food


By 2050, global food demand will increase by a projected 70% (FAO, 2009). 12% of the Earth’s ice-free land is already cultivated for crops and the potential for expanding this area is limited (Ramankutty et al., 2008; FAO, 2009).
 
The ‘yield gap’ is the difference between the predicted maximum yield of a given crop in a given area, and the actual yield in that area. Yield gaps are often largest in under-developed agricultural systems that lack suitable irrigation, chemical fertilizer and crop protection (Licker et al., 2010). The most significant contributor to yield loss is weeds, which can reduce yields by up to 80% in some crops if no action is taken (Oerke, 2005). 


Herbicides kill weeds by disrupting key metabolic processes in the plant. No new classes of herbicide have been developed since 1998, whilst multiple-herbicide resistant ‘superweeds’ are a growing problem worldwide (Norsworthy et al., 2012). High application rates of multiple mechanisms of action is an effective strategy to manage herbicide resistant weeds, but is limited by the crops’ intrinsic tolerance to the herbicide treatments.


Crops with engineered multiple herbicide resistance are the most effective weed management strategy since they allow high application rates of multiple classes of herbicide, minimising the probability of herbicide resistant weed outbreaks (Green, 2012). Herbicide resistant crops are generated by:
1. Target site resistance: In this case the crop is transformed with an enzyme with the same biochemical function as the herbicide target site, but is not herbicide-sensitive, creating a ‘metabolic bypass.’
2. Metabolic enhancement: Crops can be transformed with enzymes that degrade herbicides into a non-phytotoxic product (Pimentel and Peshin, 2012).




2 - Protoporphyrinogen IX Oxidase Inhibiting Herbicides


Protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (PPO) is an important herbicide target. PPO catalyses the FAD-dependent six electron reduction of protoporphyrinogen IX to protoporphyrin IX, which is the last common precursor to heme and chlorophyll  (Leeper, 1985). PPO-inhibiting herbicides are valuable because of their broad weed spectrum, low mammalian toxicity, rapid onset of action and low application rates (Hao et al., 2011).


2.1 Protoporphyrinogen IX Oxidase


Chlorophyll and heme biosynthesis share a common synthesis pathway in photosynthetic organisms (figure 1a). The synthesis of δ-aminolevulinic (ALA) acid differs between prokaryotes and eukaryotes but the pathway from ALA to protoporphyrin IX, the last common precursor to heme and chlorophyll, is conserved in every organism that does not rely on an exogenous source of heme (Kobayashi et al., 2014). The last common step reduces protoporphyrinogen IX into protoporphyrin IX, and is catalysed by protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (EC 1.3.3.4, Nishimura, 1995).

An extensive phylogenetic analysis of annotated protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (PPO) genes by  Kobayashi et al. (2014) suggested that PPO has evolved at least three times during the Earth’s history, resulting in the three distinct PPO subtypes: HemG, HemY and HemJ. Eukaryotes only employ oxygen-dependent HemY-type PPO (Jacobs and Jacobs, 1987). Plants encode two different PPO genes with distinct phylogenetic origins, which suggests that they were acquired during two independent endosymbiosis events  (Kobayashi et al., 2014). 


Plants rely on plastid-localized PPO1 for protoporphyrin IX production, rather than the mitochondrial PPO2. Dependence on PPO1 is demonstrated by knock-down or inhibition of this enzyme, which leads to photobleaching of the plants’ leaves and necrotic lesions that result from light exposure (Lermontova and Grimm, 2006). Inhibition of PPO1 leads to accumulation of protoporphyrinogen IX its uncontrolled auto-oxidation into protoporphyrin IX.  Protoporphyrin IX is photolabile and generates singlet oxygen species in the presence of light (Duke et al., 1991), which leads to peroxidation of fatty acids in the plasma membrane followed by necrosis. The resulting heme depletion increases carbon flux into the porphyrin synthesis pathway by removing the feedback inhibition glutamyl tRNA reductase, which accelerates the accumulation of protoporphyrin IX (Vothknecht, Kannangara and von Wettstein, 1998) increasing the toxicity of the inhibitor.


Interestingly, low-level light exposure (70 µmol m2 s-1) results in more severe damage than high level light exposure (550 µmol m2 s-1) in PPO1 knock-down tobacco. This phenomenon could be the result of an increased carbon flux into the porphyrin synthesis pathway under low-light conditions, or the lower abundance of molecular antioxidants like α-tocopherol (Lermontova and Grimm, 2006).


2.2 - PPO inhibitors
The diphenyl ether class of herbicides are an important class of PPO inhibitors that includes fomesafen (figure 1b). This class of PPO-inhibitors mimic half of protoporphyrinogen IX  in the PPO binding site, with the ether bridge occupying an equivalent position to the protoporphyrinogen IX methylene bridge (Nandihalli, Duke and Duke, 1992). The first diphenyl ether herbicide, nitrofen, was introduced in 1963 by Rohm and Haas (now Dow AgroSciences), long before the mechanism of action was known (Krämer, 2012). 


In 1963, high-throughput in vitro assays for PPO inhibition were not possible because the mechanism of action of this class of herbicides was not known (reference discovery that PPO is involved). More recently, it has become possible to determine the IC50 of a compound against PPO by exploiting the different fluorescence profiles of protoporphyrinogen IX and protoporphyrin IX using plant extracts or heterologously-expressed enzyme (Grossmann et al., 2010; Shepherd and Dailey, 2005). Now that the mechanism of action of PPO-inhibiting herbicides is relatively well understood, several quantitative structure-activity relationship models (QSARs) available (reviewed in Krämer, 2012). 


The full length coding sequence for maize PPO1 co-purifies with DnaK and GroEL when overexpressed in E. coli due to the hydrophobic N-terminal chloroplast-localisation sequence (de Marco et al., 2000, 2003); furthermore, the full-length property has a much lower Km towards protoporphyrinogen IX than the truncated variant. This advance allowed for the crystal structure for tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) PPO1 to be solved in 2004 by Koch et al. to a resolution of 2.9 Å with the inhibitor INH bound in the active site. Energy minimisation was used to simulate the docking of protoporphyrinogen IX in the active site, which is predicted to be held in place by ionic and 𝝅-stacking interactions that position the methylene bridge of the substrate close to the N5-atom of the FAD cofactor prior to electron abstraction from the substrate. 


2.3 PPO in E. coli
In  E. coli, the ‘Hem’ nomenclature is used to refer to the PPO genes. Knock-out mutants for HemG do not appear in the Keio collection of non-essential gene knockouts in E. coli (Baba et al., 2006), however mutants defective in HemG have been created in the past (Sasarman et al., 1979; Nishimura, 1995; Yang et al., 1996). These mutants were dependent on an exogenous supply of heme and were sensitive to blue light on account of unregulated accumulation of iron-free porphyrins. These mutants played an important role in the functional annotation of the HemG gene as a PPO gene.


The E. coli genome encodes copies of both HemY and HemG-type PPO genes (reference mg1665). Both genes are transcribed as part of larger operons (Gama-Castro et al., 2015) but the aforementioned  severity of HemG knockout suggests that E. coli is dependent on HemG for PPO function.  The only indication of the presence of HemY in living E. coli is inferred by the presence of the operon mRNA (Taniguchi et al., 2014; Li et al., 2010), which is not necessarily indicative that the protein is expressed.


The translation of HemY may be blocked in E. coli by the occurrence of a hairpin fold in the 5’  untranslated region (UTR) that may sequester the ribosome binding site (RBS) and start codon from the ribosome, as predicted from the -20 - +20 nucleotide sequence of the HemY gene (figure 2) using the RNAfold tool described in (Mathews et al., 2004). This RBS sequestration may be sufficient to silence translation of the HemY gene. (Osterman et al., 2012)

The structure has a predicted  minimum free energy of  -4.10 kcal/mol. Both the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the start codon are sequestered in this conformation, suggesting that this gene is not translated whilst it adopts this secondary structure (Osterman et al., 2012).

2.4 - Attempts to make PPO inhibitor-resistant crops
Development of crops resistant to PPO-inhibiting herbicides is a valuable goal and has been attempted using various approaches, including overexpression of PPOs in crops and expression of PPO variants that are not sensitive to commercially available PPO-inhibitors (Li and Nicholl, 2005).


One approach of particular interest was undertaken by Li et al. in 2003 at the Syngenta site in the Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. The objective was to produce a variant of PPO1 that was resistant to the pyrimidinedione PPO inhibitor butafenacil for use as a selection marker in transformed maize.  The PPO1 variant was produced using a directed evolution-based method that relied on a genetic selection platform.


 A library of PPO1 variants was produced from a PPO1 cDNA from A. thaliana using the XL-1 Red mutator strain of E. coli, before being transformed into the the HemG-deficient SASX38 (Sasarman et al. 1979). Strain SASX38 requires an exogenous supply of hematin to survive, unless transformed with a functional PPO gene.  Li et al. plated the transformants onto solid selection media that contained butafenacil at concentrations lethal to SASX38 cells that carried the wild type PPO1 enzyme and lacked hematin. Selection stringency was increased by illuminating the plates under mild lighting conditions. Subsequent rounds of in-vivo mutagenesis and genetic selection yielded mutants that could confer high levels of tolerance to several classes of PPO inhibitor in SASX38 cells and in transgenic A. thaliana.
Li et al. (2003) avoided selection in liquid media for the concern that the SASX38 cells would develop tolerance to the herbicide by overexpression of HemF, a coproporphyrinogen oxidase that can rescue E. coli from protoporphyrinogen IX accumulation by oxidation of protoporphyrinogen IX (Narita et al., 1999). Li et al. suggested that repression of this gene may eliminate the appearance of HemF mutants as a selection artefact. The PPO variant generated is a useful selection marker for transgenic maize, but has not been deployed in the field.


Expression of a herbicide-insensitive variant of PPO is a common approach to generating herbicide resistant plants (Li and Nicholl, 2005), though resistance via herbicide-detoxification has been explored. Given the fast-acting toxicity of PPO-inhibitors, detoxification would have to be extremely rapid in order to confer herbicide resistance to a plant. An attempt to direct the evolution of a Tau-class maize glutathione-S-transferase (GST) by Dixon et al. (2003) used reconstructive PCR to generate a mutant library from a starting set of GST variants that had previously shown activity towards the herbicide fluorodifen. This ‘DNA shuffling’ approach generated a library of 5,000 new mutants, which was screened in vitro for generic GST activity using the dye p-nitrophenol. The screening effort identified a library member capable of conferring a greater fluoridifen resistance to A. thaliana than the parent GSTs.  


3 - 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate Dioxygenase (HPPD)-inhibiting herbicides
3.1 - HPPD
4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate Dioxygenase (HPPD, EC1.13.11.27) is an important herbicide target and an area of interest for generating herbicide resistant crops. HPPD inhibitors are commonly deployed in cereal crops, which tolerate HPPD inhibitors better than broadleaf weeds and therefore allows preferential toxicity towards weeds. HPPD inhibitors are the last class of herbicides to have been discovered and are popular because of the broad spectrum of weeds that they are toxic to and because they can synergise with other herbicides, leading to the development of herbicide mixtures that allow greater application flexibility and minimise the chance of weeds developing herbicide resistance (Krämer, 2012).


HPPD is ubiquitous to aerobic organisms and catalyses the transformation of 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate to homogentisate, an important step in tyrosine catabolism (Moran, 2005). In plants, homogentisate is a precursor to both plastoquinone and α tocopherol (Soll et al., 1980; figure 3a).

Plastoquinone is an essential cofactor for the synthesis of carotenoids and in the coupling of photosystem I and II. Carotenoids are accessory light harvesting pigments that prevent generation of ROS by quenching high energy triplet-state chlorophyll b. Additionally, β-carotene is a structural element of the photosystem II core, depletion of β-carotene causes the release of chlorophyll which is phototoxic in its free state (Hawkes and Krämer, 2012). Damage from HPPD-inhibition is exacerbated by depletion of α tocopherol, an important amphipathic antioxidant that quenches reactive oxygen species generated during uncoupled photosynthesis and scavenges lipid peroxyl radicals (Munné-Bosch, 2005).
 
3.2 - HPPD Inhibitors
All known potent HPPD inhibitors contain a 1, 3 diketone moiety (Krämer, 2012). The crystal structure of tobacco (nt) HPPD with an experimental diketone inhibitor (DAS869) bound revealed that octahedral coordination of the catalytic Fe2+ was required for tight binding (Yang et al., 2004). Binding is also mediated by π-stacking of the benzoyl moiety of the inhibitor between two phenylalanine residues in the binding pocket.


HPPD inhibitors can be identified in vitro high throughput screens, such as that described by Yang et al. (2004) who used a partially purified homogentisate dioxygenase from Achromobacter xylosoxidans to couple homogentisate production to maleylacetoacetate. Production of maleylacetoacetate results in an increased absorbance at 300 nm, allowing the assay to be carried out in a microtiter plate and tracked by a plate reader. A more recent advance in HPPD-inhibitor screen is a bacterial bioassay (Rocaboy-Faquet et al., 2014) that takes advantage of the accumulation of a brown melanin-like pigment in E. coli cells that overexpress a plant HPPD gene; incubation with a potent HPPD inhibitor prevents the formation of the melanin-like pigment and allows determination of IC50 accurate in the sub-micromolar range.


Maize can rapidly metabolize HPPD inhibitors like mesotrione (figure 3b), which allows farmers to use this class of inhibitor as a selective herbicides (Mitchell et al., 2001). The essential role of cytochrome P450s in herbicide metabolism was elucidated by co-application of mesotrione with the P450 inhibitor malathion, and the subsequent discovery of the 4-hydroxy-mesotrione metabolite (Hawkes et al., 2001). Outbreaks of mesotrione-resistant weeds (Aramanthus spp.) have appeared in continuous corn seed production fields which have received repeated low doses of the herbicide (Hausman et al., 2011). Like corn, the mesotrione-resistant Aramanthus spp. tolerated high doses of the herbicide via metabolic inactivation by 4-hydroxylation of mesotrione, which suggests that a P450 may be responsible (Kaundun et al., 2017).


3.3 - HPPD-inhibitor Resistant Crops
In (2013) a Syngenta and Bayer submitted a transgenic soybean (Glycine max L.) dubbed the ‘MGI Soybean’ with engineered HPPD-inhibitor tolerance for regulatory review (Syngenta, 2013). This represents an important technology for farmers, since in the major maize-growing areas of the United States (the ‘Corn Belt’) maize crops are immediately followed by Soybean in 75% of cases (Syngenta AG, 2007). Soybean is extremely sensitive to residual HPPD-inhibitors that may persist in the soil, so it is important to produce a variety of Soybean that can tolerate this class of herbicide to allow safe crop rotation and herbicide application flexibility.


In 2007, Tim Hawkes’ team at Syngenta filed patents in the US, Europe and China for several genes that were capable of conferring HPPD-inhibitor resistance to otherwise susceptible crops (Syngenta AG, 2007). One of the patented genes was an HPPD variant cloned from wild oats (Avena fatua) which is mildly tolerant towards HPPD-inhibiting herbicides. The gene was subject to a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, random mutagenesis and gene shuffling. The resultant mutants were screened by transformation into E. coli cells plated on media supplemented with tyrosine and an HPPD-inhibiting herbicide in similar stead to the aforementioned bacterial bioassay for HPPD inhibitors  (Rocaboy-Faquet et al., 2014). Colonies that accumulated a melanin-like pigment in the presence of the herbicide were considered to be herbicide-tolerant.


To further the level of herbicide tolerance in the proposed line of Soybean, Hawkes’ team identified several putative P450s capable of metabolising herbicides by comparing quantitative trait loci (QTLs) from inbred lines of maize that had differing levels of tolerance to HPPD-inhibitor mesotrione and acetolactate-synthase inhibitor nicosulfuron.  Expression and analysis of bacterial artificial chromosomes generated from the QTLs yielded a P450 with activity towards nicosulfuron (‘Maize NSFL’) and one with activity towards mesotrione (CYP72A1). 


The CYP72A family of P450 monooxygenases have a broad range of biological functions in plants, though a phylogenetic analysis by Prall et al. (2016) revealed insights into the functional regions of the enzyme family such as the substrate recognition regions, they also found that enzymes in this family can be modelled onto the human CYP3A4 structure with a relatively high predicted accuracy, which may be a useful tool for producing mutants of this enzyme.
 
 The patent also covers CYP81A6 from rice (Oryza sativa L.), which had been previously discovered to confer tolerance to benzaton (a photosystem II inhibitor) and to the sulfonylurea class of acetolactate synthase inhibitors (Zhang et al., 2006). The product has not yet reached the market.


Monooxygenation of herbicides by P450s is an important mechanism by which crops tolerate herbicides (Siminszky, 2006). P450-mediated degradation of herbicides can be enhanced in crops by the application of chemical ‘safeners’ to the seed coat or as a foliar spray. Safeners like naphthalic anhydride induce expression of certain gene clusters that tend to include P450s capable of herbicide metabolism (Davies et al., 1998). 


Insertion of an oxygen into a herbicide can be sufficient to detoxify it in itself, as in the case of mesotrione (Kaundun et al., 2017). In other cases, hydroxylation of the herbicide is followed by conjugation with a bulky, hydrophilic molecule, such as glutathione and its subsequent export from the cytosol into the vacuole or periplasm via an ABC transporter (Yuan, Tranel and Stewart, 2007). In addition to the aforementioned MGI soybeans, exogenous P450s have been used to confer herbicide tolerance to rice (O. sativa) (Kawahigashi et al., 2005, 2008), potatoes (Solanum tuberosum, Inui and Ohkawa, 2005), tobacco (N. tabacum) and A. thaliana (Didierjean, 2002).


4 - The Cytochrome P450 Superfamily


Cytochrome P450s are a large group of heme-dependent monooxygenases first discovered in the liver microsomes of rabbits in 1962 and named ‘P450’ for their characteristic Soret band at 450 nm when bound to carbon monoxide (Omura and Sato, 1962). P450 enzymes catalyse a broad spectrum of biological reactions including, but not limited to: hormone biosynthesis, lipid metabolism and xenobiotic metabolism (Omura, 1999). 


4.1 - Anatomy of P450s 
P450s have a common overall fold, despite some sharing as little as 20% sequence identity (Graham and Peterson, 1999). A four helix bundle comprises the structural core of the enzyme (helices D, E, L and I) with an absolutely conserved cysteine residue on the L helix that ligates the heme iron. ‘Substrate recognition sites’ (SRSs) are inferred by six hypervariable regions of P450 sequences that line the substrate binding cavity (Gotoh, 1992). 


The E-x-x-K motif in the K-helix of P450s is also absolutely conserved, it is located close to the heme and is essential for the stability of the core structure (Graham and Peterson, 1999). Another consensus sequence is found in the middle of the I-helix (A/G-G-G-X-D/E-T-T/S) which forms a groove that facilitates proton transfer during oxygen activation (Ortiz de Montellano, 2015).


Eukaryotic P450s such as CYP72A1 tend to be tethered to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum by an N-terminal transmembrane sequence and a monofacial membrane binding domain on the globular region of the enzyme in the B-C and F-G loops (Williams et al., 2000). The putative biological function of this additional membrane binding domain is to orient the substrate binding site. Removal of the N-terminal sequence coupled with mutations in the F-G loop can facilitate expression of eukaryotic P450s as soluble protein in E. coli (von Wachenfeldt et al., 1997).


4.2 - P450 Catalytic Cycle
P450s can be classified based on their interaction with their redox partners (Werck-Reichhart and Feyereisen, 2000):
1. Depend on an FAD reductase and an iron-sulfur redoxin
2. Depend on an FAD/FMN-containing reductase
3. This class does not require an electron donor
4. Obtains electrons directly from NADPH


Monooxygenation occurs when the weak sixth axial ligand of the ferric heme iron is displaced by the hydrophobic substrate. This results in spin-state shift from low (S= ½) to high spin (S= 5/2) which increases the redox potential of the iron, which allows the iron to be reduced to a ferrous state. This spin state change can be detected in vitro via the shift in visible light absorbance from 420 nm to 390 mn. The change in reduction potential facilitates two consecutive electron transfer events from the P450 redox partner to the heme iron. Control of electron transfer to heme iron in this manner prevents futile reactions and therefore the generation of destructive superoxide and peroxide species. 


The first electron transfer event reduces the ferric heme iron to a ferrous state, which binds dioxygen, leading to a relatively stable ‘oxy-complex’ intermediate, where dioxygen is coordinated by the heme iron. Oxygen diffusion into the active site and its subsequent binding to the heme are fast and not usually a rate-limiting steps. The second electron transfer to the heme iron results in scission of the dioxygen O-O bond. Two protons are transferred to the distal oxygen via the proton transfer groove in the I helix resulting in the release of one water molecule. The remaining heme iron-bound oxygen becomes a reactive species due to the delocalisation of a 𝝅-cation radical on the porphyrin ring. The ‘activated’ oxygen-heme species is capable of hydroxylation, epoxidation and methylation of the bound substrate, after which water once again becomes the sixth axial ligand and the heme iron returns to its ferric state.


4.3 - P450s in Biotechnology and P450 BM3
Biotechnological applications of wild-type and engineered P450s include synthesis of drugs and fine chemicals, synthesis of valuable drug metabolites for safety profiling and biosensors capable of monitoring drug levels in blood or plasma (Kumar, 2010). Microbial P450s offer certain advantages over their eukaryotic counterparts for biotechnological applications, including their solubility, their ease of expression in E. coli and their relative ease of crystallization (Urlacher, Lutz-Wahl and Schmid, 2004).


Given their broad range of biochemical functions and their tolerance to mutation whilst still retaining their overall topology (Graham and Peterson, 1999), P450s are excellent targets for enzyme engineering attempts (Jung, Lauchli and Arnold, 2011).  The dynamic nature and conformational variability of P450 active sites allow some mutations to broaden the spectrum of latent biochemical functions by destabilising regions important for substrate binding, increasing the conformational entropy of the active site and therefore accommodating new substrates (Pochapsky, Kazanis and Dang, 2010; Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009). The power of destabilising mutations to broaden substrate specificity was exemplified in CYP102A1 from Bacillus megaterium (BM3) by Butler et al. (2013) who showed that two point mutations in the mobile B’ helix could destabilise it further and broaden the substrate specificity from fatty acids to drugs like omeprazole. 


BM3 is a catalytically self-sufficient fatty acid hydroxylase owing to a fused class II NADPH reductase domain (Fulco and Nahri, 1986). BM3 is has the highest turnover rate of any known P450 with arachidonic acid, its catalytic efficiency is a result of the fused reductase domain (Noble et al., 1999; Girvan et al., 2006).  BM3 has been engineered to fulfil diverse functions such as alkene epoxidation and to serve as a dopamine probe for fMRI studies in the brains of transgenic animals (Glieder, Farinas and Arnold, 2002; Shapiro et al., 2010). A common approach to enzyme engineering is directed evolution, which can overcome some of the unpredictable effects of multiple mutations on a proteins function by opting for high throughput screening of randomly or semi-rationally generated mutants (Jung, Lauchli and Arnold, 2011; Packer and Liu, 2015).


5 - Directed Evolution


Directed evolution is a process by which an enzyme is assigned a new biochemical function by a process of iterative mutagenesis and selection or screening of mutants with desirable properties (Packer and Liu, 2015). 


5.1 - Starting points
Where catalysis is concerned, an important consideration in directed evolution is to choose an appropriate starting enzyme, preferably one that can carry out a function similar to the desired one (e.g. a monooxygenase) whilst at the the same time, being a member of a superfamily that has a broad range of biochemical functions (Jung, Lauchli and Arnold, 2011). 


Mutations can generally be tolerated by proteins that are conformationally dynamic, a property which in itself can broaden the substrate specificity of an enzyme (O'Loughlin, 2006; Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009). At the other end of the spectrum, thermostable enzymes have been shown to also tolerate mutations well and be amenable to directed evolution (Bloom et al., 2006). A poignant example of the latter case is the evolution of a thermostable variant of BM3 that could be mutated to explore a greater sequence search space than a less thermostable counterpart by tolerating more destabilising mutations. This improved ‘evolvability’ of the thermostable variant facilitated a more efficacious directed evolution experiment.


The method by which mutants are created is largely based on the manor in which those with desirable activity are identified and carried forward to subsequent rounds of mutation. ‘Screening’ is the process of assaying mutants for desirable activity and requires intervention by a scientist or an automated platform. ‘Selection’ is the term applied to a platform that permits the survival of the cells expressing active mutants, which allows identification of mutants with desirable properties to be identified with minimal intervention (Reetz, 2017).


5.2 - Selection 
The efficiency of selection permits far larger libraries of mutants to be assessed than would be possible with screening methods, which allows mutants to be generated via random mutagenesis methods such as error prone PCR and DNA shuffling (Reetz, 2017).  The selection platform will be designed so that cells harbouring desirable mutants out compete those that do not, which relies on tight coupling of the desired enzyme function to the overall fitness of the cell. Loose coupling will result in false positives and false negatives which undermines the overall efficiency of the system (Tizei et al., 2016). The limitations of this approach is that it is only applicable to enzymes that can affect the growth rate of the host cells. 
One of the most powerful selection-based methods of directed evolution is ‘phage assisted continuous evolution’ (PACE) pioneered by Esvelt, Carlson and Liu (2011). In PACE, the gene of interest (GOI) is carried on the genome of an M13 filamentous bacteriophage that also lacks the coding sequence for the PIII, which is required for host cell entry. Conditional expression of the plasmid-encoded PIII gene is the basis of selection: a phage-encoded mutant GOI that displays the desired activity will induce expression of PIII and allow propagation of the phage vector. Active mutants are enriched by removing media from the phage-containing vessel and replacing it with fresh cells. This dilutes phage that encode a GOI with poor activity and provides successful phage with a new feedstock of E. coli. 


Initially, PACE was used to alter the substrate specificity of a T7 RNA polymerase to initiate transcription at a T3 promoter site (Esvelt, Carlson and Liu, 2011). In subsequent work, the procedure was modified to enhance the rate of mutations in vivo and to apply an additional negative selection pressure that would ensure that the engineered T7 RNA polymerase would not recognise the original T7 promoter (Carlson et al., 2014). The ability to coincide mutation with selection pressure mimics natural evolution and allows a large, although constrained sequence space to be interrogated. In addition, the ability to apply, remove or tune selection pressure allows genetic drift, which can open alternative evolutionary pathways towards a desired activity (Dickinson et al., 2013).


PACE has since been applied towards development of antiretroviral therapeutics (Dickinson et al., 2014), non-canonical aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (Bryson et al., 2017) and most relevantly: the generation of a novel variant of a Cry insecticidal protein that can be used in transgenic crops as protection from Lepidoptera sp that have evolved resistance to conventional Cry toxins (Badran et al., 2016). 


Outside of the realms of published science, the (well funded) Heidelberg 2017 iGEM team adapted PACE into a semi-continuous method that took place in shake flasks that would be used to inoculate subsequent flasks, avoiding the need for a chemostat and the risk of a phage washout. The new implementation of PACE was used to direct the evolution of human CYP1A2 that enhanced the production of theophylline from caffeine by controlling expression of PIII with a theophylline riboswitch (Team Heidelberg, 2017; Brödel, Jaramillo and Isalan, 2017). 




5.3 - Screening
Screening requires quantitative assessment of the desired function of individual mutants (Reetz, 2017). For some proteins it may be necessary to implement a screening design where a selection method is not possible, the success of which largely hinges around the efficiency of the screen. A classic example of a screening design is that of Glieder, Farinas and Arnold (2002) who screened a library of BM3 variants for putative alkane hydroxylase activity. The screen did not directly assay for alkane hydroxylase activity, but instead compromised fidelity for practicality and substituted octane for p-nitrophenoxy octane: a surrogate substrate that strongly absorbs light at 410 nm when terminally hydroxylated (Farinas, 2003). The colorimetric nature of this screen allowed the assay to be reduced to a microtiter plate format, which increased throughput, but ran the risk of identifying variants that could hydroxylate  p-nitrophenoxy octane, but not alkane substrates. 


‘You get what you screen for’ is a maxim of directed evolution (Schmidt-Dannert and Arnold, 1999); to avoid losing mutants with the desired activity, a multi-tier screening design can be implemented where the initial, cheap p-nitrophenoxy octane assay is followed by a more expensive, but substrate-specific assay to identify true positive hits.


5.4 - Library design
Glieder, Farinas and Arnold (2002) generated their mutants via error-prone PCR, which results in random nucleotide substitutions. The potential library size that this technique can generate exceeds the capacity of the screen and the number of atoms in the known universe and may not have been a suitable approach to a screen-based design. DNA Shuffling is an alternative mutagenesis technique based on in vitro recombination of related DNA sequences resulting in chimeric libraries that are amenable to selection (Crameri et al., 1998). 


Where screening designs are concerned, a semi-rational approach can generate a constrained library populated by variants that may be more likely to fulfil the desired function than randomly generated mutants (Currin et al., 2015). The semi-rational approach to directed evolution is facilitated by de novo synthesis methods such as the SpeedyGenes technique (Currin et al., 2014) where variant libraries are constructed from oligonucleotides by assembly PCR and mutations are introduced by ‘spiking in’ a primer with the desired codon substitution. The GeneGenie computational tool accompanies the technique by fragmenting the GOI into a library of mutagenic and non-mutagenic oligos in silico that can be synthesised and assembled (Swainston et al., 2014). 


The semi-rational approach can be guided by machine learning algorithms which build a predictive model trained on a dataset of sequence-activity relationships generated from preliminary rounds of mutant screening (Fox and Huisman, 2008).  One machine learning approach to directed evolution is the ProSAR (protein structure-activity relationship); an extension of the traditional SAR models used during drug and herbicide development, ProSARs require no structural knowledge of the starting protein yet can yield highly active enzyme variants by iterative cycles of design, testing and learning from the data (Fox et al., 2007). A ProSAR algorithm has been packaged into an open source web tool to enable efficient screening screening designs of directed evolution experiments (Berland et al., 2014).


6 - Conclusion
From the perspective of engineering enzymes for herbicide detoxification in crops, there is a wealth of existing work on bioassay-based screening approaches to detect HPPD-inhibiting herbicides and selection platforms to identify PPO-inhibitor resistant genes. Given the evolvable nature and their existing role in herbicide detoxification, P450 enzymes represent a good starting point directed evolution-based engineering attempts to produce a viable herbicide resistance trait that will function in planta.
