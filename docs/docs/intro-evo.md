## Abstract
Crop resistance to herbicides is an important tool in establishing global food security.
Herbicide resistance can be engineered into crops by introducing an enzyme that can metaboloicly deactivate a particular herbicide.
In this work, a mutant variant of the bacterial P450 BM3 (CYP102A1) is engineered to hydroxylate the herbicide mesotrione at ring carbon 5 as a means of deactivation.
To engineer the enzyme, a virtual directed evolution program relying on protein structure prediction, docking and genetic algorithms is developed and deployed at scale to adjust the BM3 active site to accomodate mesotrione in a favourable configuration.
The mutants produced by the algorithm are synthesized in the lab and tested for expected activity.
