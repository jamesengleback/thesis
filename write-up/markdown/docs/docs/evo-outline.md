# Outline

In order to engineer a mutant of the P450 BM3 capable of 5-hydroxylation of the herbicide mesotrione, a virtual directed evoltion program was built and deployed.
The program consists of a genetic algorithm that iteratively generates a pool of BM3 mutant sequences, predicts their structure based on an experimentally determined structure and evaluates their binding efficacy towards mesotrion by molecular docking. 
Over several generations BM3 mutants with improved predicted mesotrione binding properties are generated, which are maded and tested for predicted activity in the lab.
