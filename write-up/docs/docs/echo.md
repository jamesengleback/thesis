# echo

## Overview
`echo` is a python package written to generate custom instructions for *Labcyte Echo* low volume liquid handling machines. 
The output is a `csv` *pick list* that specifies the transfers to be made.
`echo` keeps track of sample volumes, which avoids under-dispensing due to a low volume error.
