Abstract

We develop stochastic variational inference, a scalable algorithm for approximating posterior dis-
tributions. We develop this technique for a large class of probabilistic models and we demonstrate
it with two probabilistic topic models, latent Dirichlet allocation and the hierarchical Dirichlet pro-
cess topic model. Using stochastic variational inference, we analyze several large collections of
documents: 300K articles from Nature, 1.8M articles from The New York Times, and 3.8M arti-
cles from Wikipedia. Stochastic inference can easily handle data sets of this size and outperforms
traditional variational inference, which can only handle a smaller subset. (We also show that the
Bayesian nonparametric topic model outperforms its parametric counterpart.) Stochastic variational
inference lets us apply complex Bayesian models to massive data sets.

1. Introduction

Modern data analysis requires computation with massive data. As examples, consider the following.
(1) We have an archive of the raw text of two million books, scanned and stored online. We want
to discover the themes in the texts, organize the books by subject, and build a navigator for users
to explore our collection. (2) We have data from an online shopping website containing millions of
users’ purchase histories as well as descriptions of each item in the catalog. We want to recommend
items to users based on this information. (3) We are continuously collecting data from an online
feed of photographs. We want to build a classiﬁer from these data. (4) We have measured the gene
sequences of millions of people. We want to make hypotheses about connections between observed
genes and other traits.

These problems illustrate some of the challenges to modern data analysis. Our data are com-
plex and high-dimensional; we have assumptions to make—from science, intuition, or other data
analyses—that involve structures we believe exist in the data but that we cannot directly observe;
and ﬁnally our data sets are large, possibly even arriving in a never-ending stream.

Statistical machine learning research has addressed some of these challenges by developing the
ﬁeld of probabilistic modeling, a ﬁeld that provides an elegant approach to developing new methods
for analyzing data (Pearl, 1988; Jordan, 1999; Bishop, 2006; Koller and Friedman, 2009; Murphy,
2012). In particular, probabilistic graphical models give us a visual language for expressing as-
sumptions about data and its hidden structure. The corresponding posterior inference algorithms
let us analyze data under those assumptions, inferring the hidden structure that best explains our
observations.

In descriptive tasks, like problems #1 and #4 above, graphical models help us explore the data—
the organization of books or the connections between genes and traits—with the hidden structure
probabilistically “ﬁlled in.” In predictive tasks, like problems #2 and #3, we use models to form
predictions about new observations. For example, we can make recommendations to users or pre-
dict the class labels of new images. With graphical models, we enjoy a powerful suite of probability
models to connect and combine; and we have general-purpose computational strategies for connect-
ing models to data and estimating the quantities needed to use them.

The problem we face is scale. Inference algorithms of the 1990s and 2000s used to be considered
scalable, but they cannot easily handle the amount of data that we described in the four examples
above. This is the problem we address here. We present an approach to computing with graphical
models that is appropriate for massive data sets, data that might not ﬁt in memory or even be stored
locally. Our method does not require clusters of computers or specialized hardware, though it can
be further sped up with these amenities.

As an example of this approach to data analysis, consider topic models. Topic models are
probabilistic models of text used to uncover the hidden thematic structure in a collection of docu-
ments (Blei, 2012). The main idea in a topic model is that there are a set of topics that describe
the collection and each document exhibits those topics with different degrees. As a probabilistic
model, the topics and how they relate to the documents are hidden structure and the main compu-
tational problem is to infer this hidden structure from an observed collection. Figure 1 illustrates
the results of our algorithm on a probabilistic topic model. These are two sets of topics, weighted
distributions over the vocabulary, found in 1.8M articles from the New York Times and 300,000
articles from Nature. Topic models are motivated by applications that require analyzing massive
collections of documents like this, but traditional algorithms for topic model inference do not easily
scale collections of this size.

Our algorithm builds on variational inference, a method that transforms complex inference
problems into high-dimensional optimization problems (Jordan et al., 1999; Wainwright and Jordan,
2008). Traditionally, the optimization is solved with a coordinate ascent algorithm, iterating be-
tween re-analyzing every data point in the data set and re-estimating its hidden structure. This
is inefﬁcient for large data sets, however, because it requires a full pass through the data at each
iteration.

In this paper we derive a more efﬁcient algorithm by using stochastic optimization (Robbins and Monro,

1951), a technique that follows noisy estimates of the gradient of the objective. When used in varia-
tional inference, we show that this gives an algorithm which iterates between subsampling the data

ticles from the New York Times (top) and 350K articles from Nature (bottom). (See Sec-
tion 3.3 for the modeling details behind the hierarchical Dirichlet process and Section 4
for details about the empirical study.) Each topic is a weighted distribution over the vo-
cabulary and each topic’s plot illustrates its most frequent words.

and adjusting the hidden structure based only on the subsample. This is much more efﬁcient than
traditional variational inference. We call our method stochastic variational inference.

We will derive stochastic variational inference for a large class of graphical models. We will
study its performance on two kinds of probabilistic topic models. In particular, we demonstrate
stochastic variational inference on latent Dirichlet allocation (Blei et al., 2003), a simple topic
model, and the hierarchical Dirichlet process topic model (Teh et al., 2006a), a more ﬂexible model
where the number of discovered topics grows with the data. (This latter application demonstrates
how to use stochastic variational inference in a variety of Bayesian nonparametric settings.) Stochas-
tic variational inference can efﬁciently analyze massive data sets with complex probabilistic models.
Technical summary. We now turn to the technical context of our method. In probabilistic
modeling, we use hidden variables to encode hidden structure in observed data; we articulate the
relationship between the hidden and observed variables with a factorized probability distribution
(i.e., a graphical model); and we use inference algorithms to estimate the posterior distribution, the
conditional distribution of the hidden structure given the observations.

Consider a graphical model of hidden and observed random variables for which we want to
compute the posterior. For many models of interest, this posterior is not tractable to compute and
we must appeal to approximate methods. The two most prominent strategies in statistics and ma-
chine learning are Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and variational inference.
In
MCMC sampling, we construct a Markov chain over the hidden variables whose stationary dis-
tribution is the posterior of interest (Metropolis et al., 1953; Hastings, 1970; Geman and Geman,
1984; Gelfand and Smith, 1990; Robert and Casella, 2004). We run the chain until it has (hope-
fully) reached equilibrium and collect samples to approximate the posterior. In variational inference,
we deﬁne a ﬂexible family of distributions over the hidden variables, indexed by free parameters
(Jordan et al., 1999; Wainwright and Jordan, 2008). We then ﬁnd the setting of the parameters (i.e.,
the member of the family) that is closest to the posterior. Thus we solve the inference problem by
solving an optimization problem.

Neither MCMC nor variational inference scales easily to the kinds of settings described in the
ﬁrst paragraph. Researchers have proposed speed-ups of both approaches, but these usually are
tailored to speciﬁc models or compromise the correctness of the algorithm (or both). Here, we
develop a general variational method that scales.

As we mentioned above, the main idea in this work is to use stochastic optimization (Robbins and Monro,

1951; Spall, 2003). In stochastic optimization, we ﬁnd the maximum of an objective function by
following noisy (but unbiased) estimates of its gradient. Under the right conditions, stochastic op-
timization algorithms provably converge to an optimum of the objective. Stochastic optimization
is particularly attractive when the objective (and therefore its gradient) is a sum of many terms
that can be computed independently. In that setting, we can cheaply compute noisy gradients by
subsampling only a few of these terms.

Variational inference is amenable to stochastic optimization because the variational objective
decomposes into a sum of terms, one for each data point in the analysis. We can cheaply obtain
noisy estimates of the gradient by subsampling the data and computing a scaled gradient on the
subsample.
If we sample independently then the expectation of this noisy gradient is equal to
the true gradient. With one more detail—the idea of a natural gradient (Amari, 1998)—stochastic
variational inference has an attractive form:

1. Subsample one or more data points from the data.
2. Analyze the subsample using the current variational parameters.

4

STOCHASTIC VARIATIONAL INFERENCE

3. Implement a closed-form update of the variational parameters.
4. Repeat.

While traditional algorithms require repeatedly analyzing the whole data set before updating the
variational parameters, this algorithm only requires that we analyze randomly sampled subsets. We
will show how to use this algorithm for a large class of graphical models.

Related work. Variational inference for probabilistic models was pioneered in the mid-1990s.
In Michael Jordan’s lab, the seminal papers of Saul et al. (1996); Saul and Jordan (1996) and Jaakkola
(1997) grew out of reading the statistical physics literature (Peterson and Anderson, 1987; Parisi,
1988). In parallel, the mean-ﬁeld methods explained in Neal and Hinton (1999) (originally pub-
lished in 1993) and Hinton and Van Camp (1993) led to variational algorithms for mixtures of ex-
perts (Waterhouse et al., 1996).

In subsequent years, researchers began to understand the potential for variational inference
in more general settings and developed generic algorithms for conjugate exponential-family mod-
els (Attias, 1999, 2000; Wiegerinck, 2000; Ghahramani and Beal, 2001; Xing et al., 2003). These
innovations led to automated variational inference, allowing a practitioner to write down a model
and immediately use variational inference to estimate its posterior (Bishop et al., 2003). For good
reviews of variational inference see Jordan et al. (1999) and Wainwright and Jordan (2008).

In this paper, we develop scalable methods for generic Bayesian inference by solving the vari-
ational inference problem with stochastic optimization (Robbins and Monro, 1951). Our algorithm
builds on the earlier approach of Sato (2001), whose algorithm only applies to the limited set of
models that can be ﬁt with the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977). Speciﬁcally, we generalize his
approach to the much wider set of probabilistic models that are amenable to closed-form coordinate
ascent inference. Further, in the sense that EM itself is a mean-ﬁeld method (Neal and Hinton, 1999),
our algorithm builds on the stochastic optimization approach to EM (Cappé and Moulines, 2009).
Finally, we note that stochastic optimization was also used with variational inference in Platt et al.
(2008) for fast approximate inference in a speciﬁc model of web service activity.

For approximate inference, the main alternative to variational methods is Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) (Robert and Casella, 2004). Despite its popularity in Bayesian inference, relatively
little work has focused on developing MCMC algorithms that can scale to very large data sets.
One exception is sequential Monte Carlo, although these typically lack strong convergence guaran-
tees (Doucet et al., 2001). Another is the stochastic gradient Langevin method of Welling and Teh
(2011), which enjoys asymptotic convergence guarantees and also takes advantage of stochastic op-
timization. Finally, in topic modeling, researchers have developed several approaches to parallel
MCMC (Newman et al., 2009; Smola and Narayanamurthy, 2010; Ahmed et al., 2012).

The organization of this paper.

In Section 2, we review variational inference for graphical
models and then derive stochastic variational inference. In Section 3, we review probabilistic topic
models and Bayesian nonparametric models and then derive the stochastic variational inference
algorithms in these settings. In Section 4, we study stochastic variational inference on several large
text data sets.

2. Stochastic Variational Inference

We derive stochastic variational inference, a stochastic optimization algorithm for mean-ﬁeld vari-
ational inference. Our algorithm approximates the posterior distribution of a probabilistic model
with hidden variables, and can handle massive data sets of observations.

Figure 2: A graphical model with observations x1:N , local hidden variables z1:N and global hidden
variables β. The distribution of each observation xn only depends on its corresponding lo-
cal variable zn and the global variables β. (Though not pictured, each hidden variable zn,
observation xn, and global variable β may be a collection of multiple random variables.)

We divide this section into four parts.

1. We deﬁne the class of models to which our algorithm applies. We deﬁne local and global

hidden variables, and requirements on the conditional distributions within the model.

2. We review mean-ﬁeld variational inference, an approximate inference strategy that seeks a
tractable distribution over the hidden variables which is close to the posterior distribution.
We derive the traditional variational inference algorithm for our class of models, which is a
coordinate ascent algorithm.

3. We review the natural gradient and derive the natural gradient of the variational objective

function. The natural gradient closely relates to coordinate ascent variational inference.

4. We review stochastic optimization, a technique that uses noisy estimates of a gradient to
optimize an objective function, and apply it to variational inference. Speciﬁcally, we use
stochastic optimization with noisy estimates of the natural gradient of the variational objective.
These estimates arise from repeatedly subsampling the data set. We show how the resulting
algorithm, stochastic variational inference, easily builds on traditional variational inference
algorithms but can handle much larger data sets.

2.1 Models with local and global hidden variables

Our class of models involves observations, global hidden variables, local hidden variables, and ﬁxed
parameters. The N observations are x = x1:N ; the vector of global hidden variables is β; the N
local hidden variables are z = z1:N , each of which is a collection of J variables zn = zn,1:J; the
vector of ﬁxed parameters is α. (Note we can easily allow α to partly govern any of the random
variables, such as ﬁxed parts of the conditional distribution of observations. To keep notation simple,
we assume that they only govern the global hidden variables.)

The joint distribution factorizes into a global term and a product of local terms,

p(x, z, β | α) = p(β | α)

N

Yn=1

p(xn, zn | β).

(1)

STOCHASTIC VARIATIONAL INFERENCE

Figure 2 illustrates the graphical model. Our goal is to approximate the posterior distribution of the
hidden variables given the observations, p(β, z | x).

The distinction between local and global hidden variables is determined by the conditional de-
pendencies. In particular, the nth observation xn and the nth local variable zn are conditionally
independent, given global variables β, of all other observations and local hidden variables,

p(xn, zn | x−n, z−n, β, α) = p(xn, zn | β, α).

The notation x−n and z−n refers to the set of variables except the nth.

This kind of model frequently arises in Bayesian statistics. The global variables β are parameters
endowed with a prior p(β) and each local variable zn contains the hidden structure that governs the
nth observation. For example, consider a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians. The global variables are
the mixture proportions and the means and variances of the mixture components; the local variable
zn is the hidden cluster label for the nth observation xn.

We have described the independence assumptions of the hidden variables. We make further
assumptions about the complete conditionals in the model. A complete conditional is the conditional
distribution of a hidden variable given the other hidden variables and the observations. We assume
that these distributions are in the exponential family,

p(β | x, z, α) = h(β) exp{ηg(x, z, α)⊤t(β) − ag(ηg(x, z, α))}

p(znj | xn, zn,−j, β) = h(znj) exp{ηℓ(xn, zn,−j, β)⊤t(znj) − aℓ(ηℓ(xn, zn,−j, β))}.

(2)
(3)

The scalar functions h(·) and a(·) are respectively the base measure and log-normalizer; the vector
functions η(·) and t(·) are respectively the natural parameter and sufﬁcient statistics.1 These are
conditional distributions, so the natural parameter is a function of the variables that are being con-
ditioned on. (The subscripts on the natural parameter η indicate complete conditionals for local or
global variables.) For the local variables znj, the complete conditional distribution is determined by
the global variables β and the other local variables in the nth context, i.e., the nth data point xn and
the local variables zn,−j. This follows from the factorization in Equation 1.

These assumptions on the complete conditionals imply a conjugacy relationship between the
global variables β and the local contexts (zn, xn), and this relationship implies a speciﬁc form of
the complete conditional for β. Speciﬁcally, the distribution of the local context given the global
variables must be in an exponential family,

p(xn, zn|β) = h(xn, zn) exp{β⊤t(xn, zn) − aℓ(β)}.

The prior distribution p(β) must also be in an exponential family,

p(β) = h(β) exp{α⊤t(β) − ag(α)}.

(4)

(5)

The sufﬁcient statistics are t(β) = (β, −aℓ(β)) and thus the hyperparameter α has two components
α = (α1, α2). The ﬁrst component α1 is a vector of the same dimension as β; the second component
α2 is a scalar.

1. We use overloaded notation for the functions h(·) and t(·) so that they depend on the names of their arguments; for
example, h(znj ) can be thought of as a shorthand for the more formal (but more cluttered) notation hznj (znj). This
is analogous to the standard convention of overloading the probability function p(·).

7

HOFFMAN, BLEI, WANG, AND PAISLEY

Equations 4 and 5 imply that the complete conditional for the global variable in Equation 2 is in

the same exponential family as the prior with natural parameter

ηg(x, z, α) = (α1 +PN

n=1 t(zn, xn), α2 + N ).

(6)

This form will be important when we derive stochastic variational inference in Section 2.4. See
Bernardo and Smith (1994) for a general discussion of conjugacy and the exponential family.

This family of distributions—those with local and global variables, and where the complete con-
ditionals are in the exponential family—contains many useful statistical models from the machine
learning and statistics literature. Examples include Bayesian mixture models (Ghahramani and Beal,
2000; Attias, 2000), latent Dirichlet allocation (Blei et al., 2003), hidden Markov models (and many
variants) (Rabiner, 1989; Fine et al., 1998; Fox et al., 2011b; Paisley and Carin, 2009), Kalman ﬁl-
ters (and many variants) (Kalman, 1960; Fox et al., 2011a), factorial models (Ghahramani and Jordan,
1997), hierarchical linear regression models (Gelman and Hill, 2007), hierarchical probit classiﬁca-
tion models (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989; Girolami and Rogers, 2006), probabilistic factor anal-
ysis/matrix factorization models (Spearman, 1904; Tipping and Bishop, 1999; Collins et al., 2002;
Wang, 2006; Salakhutdinov and Mnih, 2008; Paisley and Carin, 2009; Hoffman et al., 2010b), cer-
tain Bayesian nonparametric mixture models (Antoniak, 1974; Escobar and West, 1995; Teh et al.,
2006a), and others.2

Analyzing data with one of these models amounts to computing the posterior distribution of the

hidden variables given the observations,

p(z, β | x) =

.

(7)

p(x, z, β)

R p(x, z, β)dzdβ

We then use this posterior to explore the hidden structure of our data or to make predictions about
future data. For many models however, such as the examples listed above, the denominator in
Equation 7 is intractable to compute. Thus we resort to approximate posterior inference, a problem
that has been a focus of modern Bayesian statistics. We now turn to mean-ﬁeld variational inference,
the approximation inference technique which roots our strategy for scalable inference.

2.2 Mean-ﬁeld variational inference

Variational inference casts the inference problem as an optimization. We introduce a family of dis-
tributions over the hidden variables that is indexed by a set of free parameters, and then optimize
those parameters to ﬁnd the member of the family that is closest to the posterior of interest. (Close-
ness is measured with Kullback-Leibler divergence.) We use the resulting distribution, called the
variational distribution, to approximate the posterior.

In this section we review mean-ﬁeld variational inference, the form of variational inference that
uses a family where each hidden variable is independent. We describe the variational objective func-
tion, discuss the mean-ﬁeld variational family, and derive the traditional coordinate ascent algorithm
for ﬁtting the variational parameters. This algorithm is a stepping stone to stochastic variational in-
ference.

2. We note that our assumptions can be relaxed to the case where the full conditional p(β|x, z) is not tractable, but each
partial conditional p(βk|x, z, β−k) associated with the global variable βk is in a tractable exponential family. The
topic models of the next section do not require this complexity, so we chose to keep the derivation a little simpler.

STOCHASTIC VARIATIONAL INFERENCE

The evidence lower bound.

Variational inference minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) di-
vergence from the variational distribution to the posterior distribution. It maximizes the evidence
lower bound (ELBO), a lower bound on the logarithm of the marginal probability of the observa-
tions log p(x). The ELBO is equal to the negative KL divergence up to an additive constant.

We derive the ELBO by introducing a distribution over the hidden variables q(z, β) and using
Jensen’s inequality.
(Jensen’s inequality and the concavity of the logarithm function imply that
log E[f (y)] ≥ E[log f (y)] for any random variable y.) This gives the following bound on the log
marginal,

log p(x) = logZ p(x, z, β)dzdβ

≥ Eq[log p(x, z, β)] − Eq[log q(z, β)]
, L(q).

(8)

The ELBO contains two terms. The ﬁrst term is the expected log joint, Eq[log p(x, z, β)]. The
second term is the entropy of the variational distribution, −Eq[log q(z, β)]. Both of these terms
depend on q(z, β), the variational distribution of the hidden variables.

We restrict q(z, β) to be in a family that is tractable, one for which the expectations in the ELBO
can be efﬁciently computed. We then try to ﬁnd the member of the family that maximizes the ELBO.
Finally, we use the optimized distribution as a proxy for the posterior.

Solving this maximization problem is equivalent to ﬁnding the member of the family that is

closest in KL divergence to the posterior (Jordan et al., 1999; Wainwright and Jordan, 2008),

KL(q(z, β)||p(z, β|x)) = Eq [log q(z, β)] − Eq [log p(z, β | x)]

= Eq [log q(z, β)] − Eq [log p(x, z, β)] + log p(x)
= −L(q) + const.

log p(x) is replaced by a constant because it does not depend on q.

The mean-ﬁeld variational family. The simplest variational family of distributions is the mean-
ﬁeld family. In this family, each hidden variable is independent and governed by its own parameter,

N

q(z, β) = q(β | λ)

q(znj | φnj).

(9)

Yn=1

Yj=1

The global parameters λ govern the global variables; the local parameters φn govern the local vari-
ables in the nth context. The ELBO is a function of these parameters.

Equation 9 gives the factorization of the variational family, but does not specify its form. We set
q(β|λ) and q(znj|φnj) to be in the same exponential family as the complete conditional distributions
p(β|x, z) and p(znj|xn, zn,−j, β), from Equations 2 and 3. The variational parameters λ and φnj
are the natural parameters to those families,

q(β | λ) = h(β) exp{λ⊤t(β) − ag(λ)}

q(znj | φnj) = h(znj ) exp{φ⊤

njt(znj) − aℓ(φnj)}.

(10)
(11)

HOFFMAN, BLEI, WANG, AND PAISLEY

These forms of the variational distributions lead to an easy coordinate ascent algorithm. Further, the
optimal mean-ﬁeld distribution, without regard to its particular functional form, has factors in these
families (Bishop, 2006).

Note that assuming that these exponential families are the same as their corresponding condi-
tionals means that t(·) and h(·) in Equation 10 are the same functions as t(·) and h(·) in Equation 2.
Likewise, t(·) and h(·) in Equation 11 are the same as in Equation 3. We will sometimes suppress
the explicit dependence on φ and λ, substituting q(znj) for q(znj|φnj) and q(β) for q(β|λ).

The mean-ﬁeld family has several computational advantages. For one, the entropy term decom-

poses,

N

J

−Eq[log q(z, β)] = −Eλ[log q(β)] −

Eφnj [log q(znj)],

Xn=1

Xj=1

where Eφnj [·] denotes an expectation with respect to q(znj | φnj) and Eλ[·] denotes an expectation
with respect to q(β | λ). Its other computational advantages will emerge as we derive the gradients
of the variational objective and the coordinate ascent algorithm.

The gradient of the ELBO and coordinate ascent inference. We have deﬁned the objective
function in Equation 8 and the variational family in Equations 9, 10 and 11. Our goal is to optimize
the objective with respect to the variational parameters.

In traditional mean-ﬁeld variational inference, we optimize Equation 8 with coordinate ascent.
We iteratively optimize each variational parameter, holding the other parameters ﬁxed. With the
assumptions that we have made about the model and variational distribution—that each conditional
is in an exponential family and that the corresponding variational distribution is in the same expo-
nential family—we can optimize each coordinate in closed form.

We ﬁrst derive the coordinate update for the parameter λ to the variational distribution of the

global variables q(β | λ). As a function of λ, we can rewrite the objective as

L(λ) = Eq[log p(β | x, z)] − Eq[log q(β)] + const.

(12)

The ﬁrst two terms are expectations that involve β; the third term is constant with respect to λ. The
constant absorbs quantities that depend only on the other hidden variables. Those quantities do not
depend on q(β | λ) because all variables are independent in the mean-ﬁeld family.

Equation 12 reproduces the full ELBO in Equation 8. The second term of Equation 12 is the
entropy of the global variational distribution. The ﬁrst term derives from the expected log joint
likelihood, where we use the chain rule to separate terms that depend on the variable β from terms
that do not,

Eq[log p(x, z, β)] = Eq[log p(x, z)] + Eq[log p(β | x, z)].

The constant absorbs Eq[log p(x, z)], leaving the expected log conditional Eq[log p(β | x, z)].

Finally, we substitute the form of q(β | λ) in Equation 10 to obtain the ﬁnal expression for the

ELBO as a function of λ,

L(λ) = Eq[ηg(x, z, α)]⊤∇λag(λ) − λ⊤∇λag(λ) + ag(λ) + const.

(13)

In the ﬁrst and second terms on the right side, we used the exponential family identity that the expec-
tation of the sufﬁcient statistics is the gradient of the log normalizer, Eq[t(β)] = ∇λag(λ). The con-
stant has further absorbed the expected log normalizer of the conditional distribution −Eq[ag(ηg(x, z, α))],
which does not depend on q(β).

Equation 13 simpliﬁes the ELBO as a function of the global variational parameter. To derive

the coordinate ascent update, we take the gradient,

λag(λ)(Eq[ηg(x, z, α)] − λ).

We can set this gradient to zero by setting

λ = Eq[ηg(x, z, α)].

(15)

This sets the global variational parameter equal to the expected natural parameter of its complete
conditional distribution. Implementing this update, holding all other variational parameters ﬁxed,
optimizes the ELBO over λ. Notice that the mean-ﬁeld assumption plays an important role. The
update is the expected conditional parameter Eq[ηg(x, z, α)], which is an expectation of a function of
the other random variables and observations. Thanks to the mean-ﬁeld assumption, this expectation
is only a function of the local variational parameters and does not depend on λ.

We now turn to the local parameters φnj. The gradient is nearly identical to the global case,

∇φnj L = ∇2

φnj aℓ(φnj)(Eq[ηℓ(xn, zn,−j, β)] − φnj).

It equals zero when

φnj = Eq[ηℓ(xn, zn,−j, β)].

(16)

Mirroring the global update, this expectation does not depend on φnj. However, while the global
update in Equation 15 depends on all the local variational parameters—and note there is a set of
local parameters for each of the N observations—the local update in Equation 16 only depends
on the global parameters and the other parameters associated with the nth context. The computa-
tional difference between local and global updates will be important in the scalable algorithm of
Section 2.4.

The updates in Equations 15 and 16 form the algorithm for coordinate ascent variational infer-
ence, iterating between updating each local parameter and the global parameters. The full algorithm
is in Figure 3, which is guaranteed to ﬁnd a local optimum of the ELBO. Computing the expecta-
tions at each step is easy for directed graphical models with tractable complete conditionals, and in
Section 3 we show that these updates are tractable for many topic models. Figure 3 is the “classical”
variational inference algorithm, used in many settings.

HOFFMAN, BLEI, WANG, AND PAISLEY

As an aside, these updates reveal a connection between mean-ﬁeld variational inference and
Gibbs sampling (Gelfand and Smith, 1990). In Gibbs sampling, we iteratively sample from each
complete conditional. In variational inference, we take variational expectations of the natural param-
eters of the same distributions. The updates also show a connection to the expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977)—Equation 16 corresponds to the E step, and Equation 15
corresponds to the M step (Neal and Hinton, 1999).

We mentioned that the local steps (Steps 3 and 4 in Figure 3) only require computation with
the global parameters and the nth local context. Thus, the data can be distributed across many
machines and the local variational updates can be implemented in parallel. These results can then
be aggregated in Step 6 to ﬁnd the new global variational parameters.

However, the local steps also reveal an inefﬁciency in the algorithm. The algorithm begins by
initializing the global parameters λ randomly—the initial value of λ does not reﬂect any regularity
in the data. But before completing even one iteration, the algorithm must analyze every data point
using these initial (random) values. This is wasteful, especially if we expect that we can learn
something about the global variational parameters from only a subset of the data.

We solve this problem with stochastic optimization. This leads to stochastic variational infer-
ence, an efﬁcient algorithm that continually improves its estimate of the global parameters as it
analyzes more observations. Though the derivation requires some details, we have now described
all of the computational components of the algorithm. (See Figure 4.) At each iteration, we sam-
ple a data point from the data set and compute its optimal local variational parameters; we form
intermediate global parameters using classical coordinate ascent updates where the sampled data
point is repeated N times; ﬁnally, we set the new global parameters to a weighted average of the old
estimate and the intermediate parameters.

The algorithm is efﬁcient because it need not analyze the whole data set before improving the
global variational parameters, and the per-iteration steps only require computation about a single lo-
cal context. Furthermore, it only uses calculations from classical coordinate inference. Any existing
implementation of variational inference can be easily conﬁgured to this scalable alternative.

We now show how stochastic inference arises by applying stochastic optimization to the natural
gradients of the variational objective. We ﬁrst discuss natural gradients and their relationship to the
coordinate updates in mean-ﬁeld variational inference.

2.3 The natural gradient of the ELBO

The natural gradient of a function accounts for the information geometry of its parameter space,
using a Riemannian metric to adjust the direction of the traditional gradient. Amari (1998) discusses
natural gradients for maximum-likelihood estimation, which give faster convergence than standard
gradients.
In this section we describe Riemannian metrics for probability distributions and the
natural gradient of the ELBO.

Gradients and probability distributions. The classical gradient method for maximization tries

to ﬁnd a maximum of a function f (λ) by taking steps of size ρ in the direction of the gradient,

λ(t+1) = λ(t) + ρ∇λf (λ(t)).

The gradient (when it exists) points in the direction of steepest ascent. That is, the gradient ∇λf (λ)
points in the same direction as the solution to

arg max

dλ

f (λ + dλ)

subject to ||dλ||2 < ǫ2

(17)

12

STOCHASTIC VARIATIONAL INFERENCE

for sufﬁciently small ǫ. Equation 17 implies that if we could only move a tiny distance ǫ away
from λ then we should move in the direction of the gradient. Initially this seems reasonable, but
there is a complication. The gradient direction implicitly depends on the Euclidean distance metric
associated with the space in which λ lives. However, the Euclidean metric might not capture a
meaningful notion of distance between settings of λ.

The problem with Euclidean distance is especially clear in our setting, where we are trying
to optimize an objective with respect to a parameterized probability distribution q(β | λ). When
optimizing over a probability distribution, the Euclidean distance between two parameter vectors λ
and λ′ is often a poor measure of the dissimilarity of the distributions q(β | λ) and q(β | λ′). For
example, suppose q(β) is a univariate normal and λ is the mean µ and scale σ. The distributions
N (0, 10000) and N (10, 10000) are almost indistinguishable, and the Euclidean distance between
their parameter vectors is 10.
In contrast, the distributions N (0, 0.01) and N (0.1, 0.01) barely
overlap, but this is not reﬂected in the Euclidean distance between their parameter vectors, which
is only 0.1. The natural gradient corrects for this issue by redeﬁning the basic deﬁnition of the
gradient (Amari, 1998).

Natural gradients and probability distributions. A natural measure of dissimilarity between

probability distributions is the symmetrized KL divergence

Dsym

KL (λ, λ′) = Eλhlog q(β | λ)

q(β | λ′)i + Eλ′hlog q(β | λ′)
q(β | λ)i .

(18)

Symmetrized KL depends on the distributions themselves, rather than on how they are parameter-
ized; it is invariant to parameter transformations.

With distances deﬁned using symmetrized KL, we ﬁnd the direction of steepest ascent in the

same way as for gradient methods,

arg max

dλ

f (λ + dλ)

subject to Dsym

KL (λ, λ + dλ) < ǫ.

(19)

As ǫ → 0, the solution to this problem points in the same direction as the natural gradient. While
the Euclidean gradient points in the direction of steepest ascent in Euclidean space, the natural
gradient points in the direction of steepest ascent in the Riemannian space, i.e., the space where
local distance is deﬁned by KL divergence rather than the L2 norm.

We manage the more complicated constraint in Equation 19 with a Riemannian metric G(λ)
(Do Carmo, 1992). This metric deﬁnes linear transformations of λ under which the squared Eu-
clidean distance between λ and a nearby vector λ + dλ is the KL between q(β|λ) and q(β|λ + dλ),

dλT G(λ)dλ = Dsym

KL (λ, λ + dλ),

(20)

and note that the transformation can be a function of λ. Amari (1998) showed that we can compute
the natural gradient by premultiplying the gradient by the inverse of the Riemannian metric G(λ)−1,

where G is the Fisher information matrix of q(λ) (Amari, 1982; Kullback and Leibler, 1951),

ˆ∇λf (λ) , G(λ)−1∇λf (λ),

G(λ) = Eλh(∇λ log q(β | λ))(∇λ log q(β | λ))⊤i .

(21)

13

HOFFMAN, BLEI, WANG, AND PAISLEY

We can show that Equation 21 satisﬁes Equation 20 by approximating log q(β | λ + dλ) using the
ﬁrst-order Taylor approximations about λ

log q(β|λ + dλ) = O(dλ2) + log q(β|λ) + dλ⊤∇λ log q(β|λ),

q(β|λ + dλ) = O(dλ2) + q(β|λ) + q(β|λ)dλ⊤∇λ log q(β|λ),

and plugging the result into Equation 18:

Dsym

KL (λ, λ + dλ) =Zβ

(q(β|λ + dλ) − q(β|λ))(log q(β|λ + dλ) − log q(β|λ))dβ

= O(dλ3) +Zβ

q(β|λ)(dλ⊤∇λ log q(β|λ))2dβ

= O(dλ3) + Eq[(dλ⊤∇λ log q(β|λ))2] = O(dλ3) + dλ⊤G(λ)dλ.

For small enough dλ we can ignore the O(dλ3) term.

When q(β | λ) is in the exponential family (Equation 10) the metric is the second derivative of

the log normalizer,

G(λ) = Eλh(∇λ log p(β | λ))(∇λ log p(β | λ))⊤i
= Eλh(t(β) − Eλ[t(β)])(t(β) − Eλ[t(β)])⊤i

= ∇2

λag(λ).

This follows from the exponential family identity that the Hessian of the log normalizer function a
with respect to the natural parameter λ is the covariance matrix of the sufﬁcient statistic vector t(β).
Natural gradients and mean ﬁeld variational inference. We now return to variational in-
ference and compute the natural gradient of the ELBO with respect to the variational parameters.
Researchers have used the natural gradient in variational inference for nonlinear state space mod-
els (Honkela et al., 2008) and Bayesian mixtures (Sato, 2001).3

Consider the global variational parameter λ. The gradient of the ELBO with respect to λ is
in Equation 14. Since λ is a natural parameter to an exponential family distribution, the Fisher
metric deﬁned by q(β) is ∇2
λag(λ). Note that the Fisher metric is the ﬁrst term in Equation 14. We
premultiply the gradient by the inverse Fisher information to ﬁnd the natural gradient. This reveals
that the natural gradient has the following simple form,

ˆ∇λL = Eφ[ηg(x, z, α)] − λ.

(22)

An analogous computation goes through for the local variational parameters,

ˆ∇φnj L = Eλ,φn,−j [ηℓ(xn, zn,−j, β)] − φnj.

The natural gradients are closely related to the coordinate ascent updates of Equation 15 or Equa-
tion 16. Consider a full set of variational parameters λ and φ. We can compute the natural gradient

3. Our work here—using the natural gradient in a stochastic optimization algorithm—is closest to that of Sato (2001),
though we develop the algorithm via a different path and Sato does not address models for which the joint conditional
p(zn|β, xn) is not tractable.

14

STOCHASTIC VARIATIONAL INFERENCE

by computing the coordinate updates in parallel and subtracting the current setting of the parameters.
The classical coordinate ascent algorithm can thus be interpreted as a projected natural gradient al-
gorithm (Sato, 2001). Updating a parameter by taking a natural gradient step of length one is
equivalent to performing a coordinate update.

We motivated natural gradients by mathematical reasoning around the geometry of the parame-
ter space. More importantly, however, natural gradients are easier to compute than classical gradi-
ents. They are easier to compute because premultiplying by the Fisher information matrix—which
we must do to compute the classical gradient in Equation 14 but which disappears from the natural
gradient in Equation 22—is prohibitively expensive for variational parameters with many compo-
nents. In the next section we will see that efﬁciently computing the natural gradient lets us develop
scalable variational inference algorithms.

2.4 Stochastic variational inference

The coordinate ascent algorithm in Figure 3 is inefﬁcient for large data sets because we must opti-
mize the local variational parameters for each data point before re-estimating the global variational
parameters. Stochastic variational inference uses stochastic optimization to ﬁt the global variational
parameters. We repeatedly subsample the data to form noisy estimates of the natural gradient of the
ELBO, and we follow these estimates with a decreasing step-size.

We have reviewed mean-ﬁeld variational inference in models with exponential family condition-
als and showed that the natural gradient of the variational objective function is easy to compute. We
now discuss stochastic optimization, which uses a series of noisy estimates of the gradient, and use
it with noisy natural gradients to derive stochastic variational inference.

Stochastic optimization.

Stochastic optimization algorithms follow noisy estimates of the
gradient with a decreasing step size. Noisy estimates of a gradient are often cheaper to compute than
the true gradient, and following such estimates can allow algorithms to escape shallow local optima
of complex objective functions. In statistical estimation problems, including variational inference
of the global parameters, the gradient can be written as a sum of terms (one for each data point) and
we can compute a fast noisy approximation by subsampling the data. With certain conditions on the
step-size schedule, these algorithms provably converge to an optimum (Robbins and Monro, 1951).
Spall (2003) gives an overview of stochastic optimization; Bottou (2003) gives an overview of its
role in machine learning.

Consider an objective function f (λ) and a random function B(λ) that has expectation equal to
the gradient so that Eq[B(λ)] = ∇λf (λ). The stochastic gradient algorithm, which is a type of
stochastic optimization, optimizes f (λ) by iteratively following realizations of B(λ). At iteration t,
the update for λ is

λ(t) = λ(t−1) + ρtbt(λ(t−1)),

where bt is an independent draw from the noisy gradient B. If the sequence of step sizes ρt satisﬁes

P ρt = ∞
P ρ2

t < ∞

(23)

then λ(t) will converge to the optimal λ∗ (if f is convex) or a local optimum of f (if not convex).4
The same results apply if we premultiply the noisy gradients bt by a sequence of positive-deﬁnite

4. To ﬁnd a local optimum, f must be three-times differentiable and meet a few mild technical requirements (Bottou,

1998). The variational objective satisﬁes these criteria.

matrices G−1

t

(whose eigenvalues are bounded) (Bottou, 1998). The resulting algorithm is

λ(t) = λ(t−1) + ρtG−1

t bt(λ(t−1)).

As our notation suggests, we will use the Fisher metric for Gt, replacing stochastic Euclidean gra-
dients with stochastic natural gradients.

Stochastic variational inference. We use stochastic optimization with noisy natural gradients to
optimize the variational objective function. The resulting algorithm is in Figure 4. At each iteration
we have a current setting of the global variational parameters. We repeat the following steps:

1. Sample a data point from the set; optimize its local variational parameters.

2. Form intermediate global variational parameters, as though we were running classical coordi-

nate ascent and the sampled data point were repeated N times to form the collection.

3. Update the global variational parameters to be a weighted average of the intermediate param-

eters and their current setting.

We show that this algorithm is stochastic natural gradient ascent on the global variational parame-
ters.

Our goal is to ﬁnd a setting of the global variational parameters λ that maximizes the ELBO.
Writing L as a function of the global and local variational parameters, Let the function φ(λ) return
a local optimum of the local variational parameters so that

Deﬁne the locally maximized ELBO L(λ) to be the ELBO when λ is held ﬁxed and the local varia-
tional parameters φ are set to a local optimum φ(λ),

∇φL(λ, φ(λ)) = 0.

L(λ) , L(λ, φ(λ)).

We can compute the (natural) gradient of L(λ) by ﬁrst ﬁnding the corresponding optimal local pa-
rameters φ(λ) and then computing the (natural) gradient of L(λ, φ(λ)), holding φ(λ) ﬁxed. The rea-
son is that the gradient of L(λ) is the same as the gradient of the two-parameter ELBO L(λ, φ(λ)),

∇λL(λ) = ∇λL(λ, φ(λ)) + (∇λφ(λ))⊤∇φL(λ, φ(λ))

= ∇λL(λ, φ(λ)),

(24)
(25)

where ∇λφ(λ) is the Jacobian of φ(λ) and we use the fact that the gradient of L(λ, φ) with respect
to φ is zero at φ(λ).

Stochastic variational inference optimizes the maximized ELBO L(λ) by subsampling the data
to form noisy estimates of the natural gradient. First, we decompose L(λ) into a global term and a
sum of local terms,

L(λ) = Eq[log p(β)] − Eq[log q(β)] +

(Eq[log p(xn, zn | β)] − Eq[log q(zn)]).

Now consider a variable that chooses an index of the data uniformly at random, I ∼ Unif(1, . . . , N ).

(Eq[log p(xI , zI | β) − Eq[log q(zI )]) .

(27)

16

STOCHASTIC VARIATIONAL INFERENCE

The expectation of LI is equal to the objective in Equation 26. Therefore, the natural gradient of LI
with respect to each global variational parameter λ is a noisy but unbiased estimate of the natural
gradient of the variational objective. This process—sampling a data point and then computing the
natural gradient of LI—will provide cheaply computed noisy gradients for stochastic optimization.
We now compute the noisy gradient. Suppose we have sampled the ith data point. Notice that
Equation 27 is equivalent to the full objective of Equation 26 where the ith data point is observed N
times. Thus the natural gradient of Equation 27—which is a noisy natural gradient of the ELBO—
can be found using Equation 22,

We compute this expression in more detail. Recall the complete conditional ηg(x, z, α) from
Equation 6. From this equation, we can compute the conditional natural parameter for the global
parameter given N replicates of xn,

Using this in the natural gradient of Equation 22 gives a noisy natural gradient,

ˆ∇λLi = α + N ·(cid:0)E

where φi(λ) gives the elements of φ(λ) associated with the ith local context. While the full natural
gradient would use the local variational parameters for the whole data set, the noisy natural gradient
only considers the local parameters for one randomly sampled data point. These noisy gradients are
cheaper to compute.

Finally, we use the noisy natural gradients in a Robbins-Monro algorithm to optimize the ELBO.
We sample a data point xi at each iteration. Deﬁne the intermediate global parameter ˆλt to be the
estimate of λ that we would obtain if the sampled data point was replicated N times,

ˆλt , α + N E

φi(λ)[(t(xi, zi), 1)].

This comprises the ﬁrst two terms of the noisy natural gradient. At each iteration we use the noisy
gradient (with step size ρt) to update the global variational parameter. The update is

λ(t) = λ(t−1) + ρt(cid:16)ˆλt − λ(t−1)(cid:17)

= (1 − ρt)λ(t−1) + ρtˆλt.

This is a weighted average of the previous estimate of λ and the estimate of λ that we would obtain
if the sampled data point was replicated N times.

Figure 4 presents the full algorithm. At each iteration, the algorithm has an estimate of the global
variational parameter λ(t−1). It samples a single data point from the data and cheaply computes the
intermediate global parameter ˆλt, i.e., the next value of λ if the data set contained N replicates of
the sampled point. It then sets the new estimate of the global parameter to be a weighted average of
the previous estimate and the intermediate parameter.

We set the step-size at iteration t as follows,

ρt = (t + τ )−κ.

(28)

This satisﬁes the conditions in Equation 23. The forgetting rate κ ∈ (0.5, 1] controls how quickly
old information is forgotten; the delay τ ≥ 0 down-weights early iterations. In Section 4 we ﬁx
the delay to be one and explore a variety of forgetting rates. Note that this is just one way to
parameterize the learning rate. As long as the step size conditions in Equation 23 are satisﬁed, this
iterative algorithm converges to a local optimum of the ELBO.

2.5 Extensions

We now describe two extensions of the basic stochastic inference algorithm in Figure 4: the use of
multiple samples (“minibatches”) to improve the algorithm’s stability, and empirical Bayes methods
for hyperparameter estimation.

Minibatches.

So far, we have considered stochastic variational inference algorithms where
only one observation xt is sampled at a time. Many stochastic optimization algorithms beneﬁt
from “minibatches,” i.e., several examples at a time (Bottou and Bousquet, 2008; Liang et al., 2009;
Mairal et al., 2010). In stochastic variational inference, we can sample a set of S examples at each
iteration xt,1:S (with or without replacement), compute the local variational parameters φs(λ(t−1))
for each data point, compute the intermediate global parameters ˆλs for each data point xts, and

18

STOCHASTIC VARIATIONAL INFERENCE

ﬁnally average the ˆλs variables in the update

λ(t) = (1 − ρt)λ(t−1) +

ˆλs.

ρt

S Xs

The stochastic natural gradients associated with each point xs have expected value equal to the
gradient. Therefore, the average of these stochastic natural gradients has the same expectation and
the algorithm remains valid.

There are two reasons to use minibatches. The ﬁrst reason is to amortize any computational
expenses associated with updating the global parameters across more data points; for example, if
the expected sufﬁcient statistics of β are expensive to compute, using minibatches allows us to incur
that expense less frequently. The second reason is that it may help the algorithm to ﬁnd better local
optima. Stochastic variational inference is guaranteed to converge to a local optimum but taking
large steps on the basis of very few data points may lead to a poor one. As we will see in Section 4,
using more of the data per update can help the algorithm.

Empirical Bayes estimation of hyperparameters.

In some cases we may want to both estimate
the posterior of the hidden random variables β and z and obtain a point estimate of the values of the
hyperparameters α. One approach to ﬁtting α is to try to maximize the marginal likelihood of the
data p(x | α), which is also known as empirical Bayes (Maritz and Lwin, 1989) estimation. Since we
cannot compute p(x | α) exactly, an approximate approach is to maximize the ﬁtted variational lower
bound L over α. In the non-stochastic setting, α can be optimized by interleaving the coordinate
ascent updates in Figure 3 with an update for α that increases the ELBO. This is called variational
expectation-maximization.

In the stochastic setting, we update α simultaneously with λ. We can take a step in the direction

of the gradient of the noisy ELBO Lt (Equation 27) with respect to α, scaled by the step-size ρt,

α(t) = α(t−1) + ρt∇αLt(λ(t−1), φ, α(t−1)).

Here λ(t−1) are the global parameters from the previous iteration and φ are the optimized local
parameters for the currently sampled data point. We can also replace the standard Euclidean gradient
with a natural gradient or Newton step.

3. Stochastic Variational Inference in Topic Models

We derived stochastic variational inference, a scalable inference algorithm that can be applied to
a large class of hierarchical Bayesian models.
In this section we show how to use the general
algorithm of Section 2 to derive stochastic variational inference for two probabilistic topic models:
latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) and its Bayesian nonparametric counterpart, the
hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) topic model (Teh et al., 2006a).

Topic models are probabilistic models of document collections that use latent variables to en-
code recurring patterns of word use (Blei, 2012). Topic modeling algorithms are inference algo-
rithms; they uncover a set of patterns that pervade a collection and represent each document ac-
cording to how it exhibits them. These patterns tend to be thematically coherent, which is why
the models are called “topic models.” Topic models are used for both descriptive tasks, such as to
build thematic navigators of large collections of documents, and for predictive tasks, such as to aid
document classiﬁcation. Topic models have been extended and applied in many domains.

19

HOFFMAN, BLEI, WANG, AND PAISLEY

Topic models assume that the words of each document arise from a mixture of multinomials.
Across a collection, the documents share the same mixture components (called topics). Each doc-
ument, however, is associated with its own mixture proportions (called topic proportions). In this
way, topic models represent documents heterogeneously—the documents share the same set of top-
ics, but each exhibits them to a different degree. For example, a document about sports and health
will be associated with the sports and health topics; a document about sports and business will be
associated with the sports and business topics. They both share the sports topic, but each combines
sports with a different topic. More generally, this is called mixed membership (Erosheva, 2003).

The central computational problem in topic modeling is posterior inference: Given a collection
of documents, what are the topics that it exhibits and how does each document exhibit them? In
practical applications of topic models, scale is important—these models promise an unsupervised
approach to organizing large collections of text (and, with simple adaptations, images, sound, and
other data). Thus they are a good testbed for stochastic variational inference.

More broadly, this section illustrates how to use the results from Section 2 to develop algorithms
for speciﬁc models. We will derive the algorithms in several steps: (1) we specify the model assump-
tions; (2) we derive the complete conditional distributions of the latent variables; (3) we form the
mean-ﬁeld variational family; (4) we derive the corresponding stochastic inference algorithm. In
Section 4, we will report our empirical study of stochastic variational inference with these models.

3.1 Notation

We follow the notation of Blei et al. (2003).

• Observations are words, organized into documents. The nth word in the dth document is wdn.

Each word is an element in a ﬁxed vocabulary of V terms.

• A topic βk is a distribution over the vocabulary. Each topic is a point on the V − 1-simplex, a
positive vector of length V that sums to one. We denote the wth entry in the kth topic as βkw.
In LDA there are K topics; in the HDP topic model there are an inﬁnite number of topics.

• Each document in the collection is associated with a vector of topic proportions θd, which
is a distribution over topics. In LDA θd is a point on the K − 1-simplex. In the HDP topic
model, θd is a point on the inﬁnite simplex. (We give details about this below in Section 3.3.)
We denote the kth entry of the topic proportion vector θd as θdk.

• Each word in each document is assumed to have been drawn from a single topic. The topic

assignment zdn indexes the topic from which wdn is drawn.

The only observed variables are the words of the documents. The topics, topic proportions, and

topic assignments are latent variables.

3.2 Latent Dirichlet allocation

LDA is the simplest topic model. It assumes that each document exhibits K topics with different
proportions. The generative process is

1. Draw topics βk ∼ Dirichlet(η, . . . , η) for k ∈ {1, . . . , K}.

Figure 5 illustrates LDA as a graphical model.

In LDA, each document exhibits the same shared topics but with different proportions. LDA
assumes Dirichlet priors for βk and θd. Dirichlet distributions over the D-simplex take D + 1
parameters, but for simplicity we assume exchangeable Dirichlet priors; that is, we require that all
of these parameters are set to the same value. (The prior on βk has parameter η; the prior on θd has
parameter α.). We note that Blei et al. (2003) and Wallach et al. (2009) found improved empirical
performance with non-exchangeable priors.

LDA models an observed collection of documents w = w1:D, where each wd is a collection
of words wd,1:N . Analyzing the documents amounts to posterior inference of p(β, θ, z | w). Condi-
tioned on the documents, the posterior distribution captures the topics that describe them (β = β1:K),
the degree to which each document exhibits those topics (θ = θ1:D), and which topics each word
was assigned to (z = z1:D,1:N). We can use the posterior to explore large collections of documents.
Figure 1 illustrates posterior topics found with stochastic variational inference.

The posterior is intractable to compute (Blei et al., 2003). Approximating the posterior in LDA
is a central computational problem for topic modeling. Researchers have developed many methods,
including Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (Grifﬁths and Steyvers, 2004), expectation propa-
gation (Minka and Lafferty, 2002), and variational inference (Blei et al., 2003; Teh et al., 2006b;
Asuncion et al., 2009). Here we use the results of Section 2 to develop stochastic inference for
LDA. This scales the original variational algorithm for LDA to massive collections of documents.5
Figure 7 illustrates the performance of 100-topic LDA on three large collections—Nature con-
tains 350K documents, New York Times contains 1.8M documents, and Wikipedia contains 3.8M
documents. (Section 4 describes the complete study, including the details of the performance mea-
sure and corpora.) We compare two inference algorithms for LDA: stochastic inference on the full
collection and batch inference on a subset of 100,000 documents. (This is the size of collection that
batch inference can handle.) We see that stochastic variational inference converges faster and to a
better model. It is both more efﬁcient and lets us handle the full data set.

Indicator vectors and Dirichlet distributions. Before deriving the algorithm, we discuss two

mathematical details. These will be useful both here and in the next section.

First, we represent categorical variables like the topic assignments zdn and observed words wdn
with indicator vectors. An indicator vector is a binary vector with a single one. For example, the
topic assignment zdn can take on one of K values (one for each topic). Thus, it is represented as
a K-vector with a one in the component corresponding to the value of the variable: if zk
dn = 1
dn = 1 implies that the
then the nth word in document d is assigned to the kth topic. Likewise, wv
nth word in document d is v. In a slight abuse of notation, we will sometimes use wdn and zdn as
indices—for example, if zk

dn = 1, then βzdn refers to the kth topic βk.

Second, we review the Dirichlet distribution. As we described above, a K-dimensional Dirichlet
is a distribution on the K − 1-simplex, i.e., positive vectors over K elements that sum to one. It is

5. The algorithm we present was originally developed in Hoffman et al. (2010a), which is a special case of the stochastic

variational inference algorithm we developed in Section 2.

(29)

This can be derived by putting the Dirichlet in exponential family form, noticing that log θ is the vec-
tor of sufﬁcient statistics, and computing its expectation by taking the gradient of the log-normalizer
with respect to the natural parameter vector γ.

Complete conditionals and variational distributions. We specify the global and local variables
of LDA to place it in the stochastic variational inference setting of Section 2. In topic modeling,
the local context is a document d. The local observations are its observed words wd,1:N . The local
hidden variables are the topic proportions θd and the topic assignments zd,1:N . The global hidden
variables are the topics β1:K.

Recall from Section 2 that the complete conditional is the conditional distribution of a vari-
able given all of the other variables, hidden and observed. In mean-ﬁeld variational inference, the
variational distributions of each variable are in the same family as the complete conditional.

We begin with the topic assignment zdn. The complete conditional of the topic assignment is a

multinomial,

p(zdn = k | θd, β1:K , wdn) ∝ exp{log θdk + log βk,wdn}.

(30)

Thus its variational distribution is a multinomial q(zdn) = Multinomial(φdn), where the variational
parameter φdn is a point on the K − 1-simplex. Per the mean-ﬁeld approximation, each observed
word is endowed with a different variational distribution for its topic assignment, allowing different
words to be associated with different topics.

The complete conditional of the topic proportions is a Dirichlet,

p(θd | zd) = Dirichlet(cid:16)α +PN

n=1 zdn(cid:17) .

(31)

Since zdn is an indicator vector, the kth element of the parameter to this Dirichlet is the sum of the
hyperparameter α and the number of words assigned to topic k in document d. Note that, although
we have assumed an exchangeable Dirichlet prior, when we condition on z the conditional p(θd|zd)
is a non-exchangeable Dirichlet.

With this conditional, the variational distribution of the topic proportions is also Dirichlet q(θd) =
Dirichlet(γd), where γd is a K-vector Dirichlet parameter. There is a different variational Dirichlet
parameter for each document, allowing different documents to be associated with different topics in
different proportions.

23

HOFFMAN, BLEI, WANG, AND PAISLEY

These are local hidden variables. The complete conditionals only depend on other variables in
the local context (i.e., the document) and the global variables; they do not depend on variables from
other documents.

Finally, the complete conditional for the topic βk is also a Dirichlet,

p(βk | z, w) = Dirichlet(cid:16)η +PD

d=1PN

n=1 zk

dnwdn(cid:17) .

(32)

The vth element of the parameter to the Dirichlet conditional for topic k is the sum of the hyper-
parameter η and the number of times that the term v was assigned to topic k. This is a global
variable—its complete conditional depends on the words and topic assignments of the entire collec-
tion.

The variational distribution for each topic is a V -dimensional Dirichlet,

q(βk) = Dirichlet(λk).

As we will see in the next section, the traditional variational inference algorithm for LDA is inefﬁ-
cient with large collections of documents. The root of this inefﬁciency is the update for the topic
parameter λk, which (from Equation 32) requires summing over variational parameters for every
word in the collection.

Batch variational inference.
With the complete conditionals in hand, we now derive the coordinate ascent variational infer-
ence algorithm, i.e., the batch inference algorithm of Figure 3. We form each coordinate update by
taking the expectation of the natural parameter of the complete conditional. This is the stepping
stone to stochastic variational inference.

The variational parameters are the global per-topic Dirichlet parameters λ1:K, local per-document
Dirichlet parameters γ1:D, and local per-word multinomial parameters φ1:D,1:N . Coordinate ascent
variational inference iterates between updating all of the local variational parameters (Equation 16)
and updating the global variational parameters (Equation 15).

We update each document d’s local variational in a local coordinate ascent routine, iterating

between updating each word’s topic assignment and the per-document topic proportions,

φk

dn ∝ exp {Ψ(γdk) + Ψ(λk,wdn) − Ψ (Pv λkv)}
γd = α +PN

n=1 φdn.

for n ∈ {1, . . . , N }

(33)
(34)

These updates derive from taking the expectations of the natural parameters of the complete con-
ditionals in Equation 30 and Equation 31. (We then map back to the usual parameterization of
the multinomial.) For the update on the topic assignment, we have used the Dirichlet expectations
in Equation 29. For the update on the topic proportions, we have used that the expectation of an
indicator is its probability, Eq[zk

dn] = φk

dn.

After ﬁnding variational parameters for each document, we update the variational Dirichlet for

each topic,

This update depends on the variational parameters φ from every document.

Batch inference is inefﬁcient for large collections of documents. Before updating the topics
λ1:K, we compute the local variational parameters for every document. This is particularly wasteful

in the beginning of the algorithm when, before completing the ﬁrst iteration, we must analyze every
document with randomly initialized topics.

Stochastic variational inference
Stochastic variational inference provides a scalable method for approximate posterior inference
in LDA. The global variational parameters are the topic Dirichlet parameters λk; the local variational
parameters are the per-document topic proportion Dirichlet parameters γd and the per-word topic
assignment multinomial parameters φdn.

We follow the general algorithm of Figure 4. Let λ(t) be the topics at iteration t. At each
iteration we sample a document d from the collection.
In the local phase, we compute optimal
variational parameters by iterating between updating the per-document parameters γd (Equation 34)
and φd,1:N (Equation 33). This is the same subroutine as in batch inference, though here we only
analyze one randomly chosen document.

In the global phase we use these ﬁtted local variational parameters to form intermediate topics,

ˆλk = η + DPN

This comes from applying Equation 35 to a hypothetical corpus containing D replicates of document
d. We then set the topics at the next iteration to be a weighted combination of the intermediate topics
and current topics,

6. This algorithm, as well as the algorithm for the HDP, speciﬁes that we initialize the topics λk randomly. There are

many ways to initialize the topics. We use an exponential distribution,

λkv − η ∼ Exponential(D ∗ 100/(KV )).

This gives a setting of λ similar to the one we would get by applying Equation 35 after randomly assigning words to
topics in a corpus of size D with 100 words per document.

3.3 Bayesian nonparametric topic models with the HDP

Stochastic inference for LDA lets us analyze large collections of documents. One limitation of
LDA, however, is that the number of topics is ﬁxed in advance. Typically, researchers ﬁnd the
“best” number of topics with cross-validation (Blei et al., 2003). However, for very large data this
approach is not practical. We can address this issue with a Bayesian nonparametric topic model, a
model where the documents themselves determine the number of topics.

We derive stochastic variational inference for the Bayesian nonparametric variant of LDA, the
hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) topic model. Like LDA, the HDP topic model is a mixed-
membership model of text collections. However, the HDP assumes an “inﬁnite” number of topics.
Given a collection of documents, the posterior distribution of the hidden structure determines how
many topics are needed to describe them. Further, the HDP is ﬂexible in that it allows future data to
exhibit new and previously unseen topics.

More broadly, stochastic variational inference for the HDP topic model demonstrates the possi-
bilities of stochastic inference in the context of Bayesian nonparametric statistics. Bayesian nonpara-
metrics gives us a collection of ﬂexible models—mixture models, mixed-membership models, factor
models, and models with more complex structure—which grow and expand with data (Hjort et al.,
2010). Flexible and expanding models are particularly important when analyzing large data sets,
where it is prohibitive to search for a speciﬁc latent structure (such as a number of topics or a
tree structure of components) with cross-validation. Here we demonstrate how to use stochastic
inference in the context of a simple Bayesian nonparametric topic model. In other work, we built
on this algorithm to give scalable inference methods for Bayesian nonparametric models of topic
correlation (Paisley et al., 2012b) and tree structures of topics (Paisley et al., 2012c).

This section is organized as follows. We ﬁrst give some background on the Dirichlet process
and its deﬁnition via Sethuraman’s stick breaking construction, which is a distribution on the inﬁnite
simplex. We then show how to use this construction to form the HDP topic model and how to use
stochastic variational inference to approximate the posterior.7

The stick-breaking construction of the Dirichlet process. Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) meth-
ods use distributions of distributions, placing ﬂexible priors on the shape of the data-generating
density function. BNP models draw a distribution from that prior and then independently draw data
from that random distribution. Data analysis proceeds by evaluating the posterior distribution of the
(random) distribution from which the data were drawn. Because of the ﬂexible prior, that posterior
can potentially have mass on a wide variety of distribution shapes. For a reviews of BNP methods,
see the edited volume of Hjort et al. (2010) and the tutorial of Gershman and Blei (2012).

The most common BNP prior is the Dirichlet process (DP). The Dirichlet process is parame-
terized by a base distribution G0 (which may be either continuous or discrete) and a non-negative
scaling factor α. These are used to form a distribution over discrete distributions, i.e., over distri-
butions that place their mass on a countably inﬁnite set of atoms. The locations of the atoms are
independently drawn from the base distribution G0 and the closeness of the probabilities to G0 is
determined by the scaling factor α. When α is small, more mass is placed on fewer atoms, and
the draw will likely look very different from G0; when α is large, the mass is spread around many
atoms, and the draw will more closely resemble the base distribution.

7. This algorithm ﬁrst appeared in Wang et al. (2011). Here we place it in the more general context of Section 2 and

relate it to stochastic inference for LDA.

27

HOFFMAN, BLEI, WANG, AND PAISLEY

There are several representations of the Dirichlet process. For example, it is a normalized

gamma process (Ferguson, 1973), and its marginalization gives the Chinese restaurant process (Pitman,
2002). We will focus on its deﬁnition via Sethuraman’s stick breaking construction (Sethuraman,
1994). The stick-breaking construction explicitly deﬁnes the distribution of the probabilities that
make up a random discrete distribution. It is the gateway to variational inference in Bayesian non-
parametric models (Blei and Jordan, 2006).

Let G ∼ DP(α, G0) be drawn from a Dirichlet process prior. It is a discrete distribution with
mass on an inﬁnite set of atoms. Let βk be the atoms in this distribution and σk be their correspond-
ing probabilities. We can write G as

∞

G =

σkδβk .

Xk=1

The atoms are drawn independently from G0. The stick-breaking construction speciﬁes the distri-
bution of their probabilities.

The stick-breaking construction uses an inﬁnite collection of beta-distributed random variables.

Recall that the beta is a distribution on (0, 1) and deﬁne the following collection,

vi ∼ Beta(1, α)

i ∈ {1, 2, 3, . . .}.

These variables combine to form a point on the inﬁnite simplex. Imagine a stick of unit length.
Break off the proportion of the stick given by v1, call it σ1, and set it aside. From the remainder (of
length 1 − σ1) break off the proportion given by v2, call it σ2, and set it aside. The remainder of
the stick is now 1 − σ2 − σ1 = (1 − v1)(1 − v2). Repeat this process for the inﬁnite set of vi. The
resulting stick lengths σi will sum to one.

More formally, we deﬁne the function σi to take the collection of realized vi variables and to

return the stick length of the ith component,

i=1 σi(v) = 1. We call vi the ith breaking proportion.

Combining these steps, we form the distribution G according to the following process,

and note thatP∞

σi(v) = viQi−1

j=1(1 − vj),

βi ∼ G0
vi ∼ Beta(1, α)

i ∈ {1, 2, 3, . . .}

i ∈ {1, 2, 3, . . .}

G = P∞

i=1 σi(v)δβi .

In the random distribution G the ith atom βi is an independent draw from G0 and it has proba-
bility given by the ith stick length σi(v). Sethuraman (1994) showed that the distribution of G is
DP(α, G0).

The most important property of G is the “clustering” property. Even though G places mass on
a countably inﬁnite set of atoms, N draws from G will tend to exhibit only a small number of them.
(How many depends on the scalar α, as we described above.) Formally, this is most easily seen
via other perspectives on the DP (Ferguson, 1973; Blackwell and MacQueen, 1973; Pitman, 2002),
though it can be seen intuitively with the stick-breaking construction. The intuition is that as α gets
smaller more of the stick is absorbed in the ﬁrst break locations because the breaking proportions
are drawn from Beta(1, α). Thus, those atoms associated with the ﬁrst breaks of the stick will have

28

STOCHASTIC VARIATIONAL INFERENCE

larger mass in the distribution G, and that in turn encourages draws from the distribution to realize
fewer individual atoms. In general, the ﬁrst break locations tend to be larger than the later break
locations. This property is called size biasedness.

The HDP topic model. We now construct a Bayesian nonparametric topic model that has
an “inﬁnite” number of topics. The hierarchical Dirichlet process topic model couples a set of
document-level DPs via a single top-level DP (Teh et al., 2006a). The base distribution H of the
top-level DP is a symmetric Dirichlet over the vocabulary simplex—its atoms are topics. We draw
once from this DP, G0 ∼ DP(ω, H).
In the second level, we use G0 as a base measure to a
document-level DP, Gd ∼ DP(α, G0). We draw the words of each document d from topics from
Gd. The consequence of this two-level construction is that all documents share the same collection
of topics but exhibit them with different proportions.

We construct the HDP topic model using a stick-breaking construction at each level—one at the
document level and one at the corpus level.8 The generative process of the HDP topic model is as
follows.

1. Draw an inﬁnite number of topics, βk ∼ Dirichlet(η) for k ∈ {1, 2, 3, . . .}.

2. Draw corpus breaking proportions, vk ∼ Beta(1, ω) for k ∈ {1, 2, 3, . . .}.

3. For each document d:

(a) Draw document-level topic indices, cdi ∼ Multinomial(σ(v)) for i ∈ {1, 2, 3, . . .}.
(b) Draw document breaking proportions, πdi ∼ Beta(1, α) for i ∈ {1, 2, 3, . . .}.
(c) For each word n:

i. Draw topic assignment zdn ∼ Multinomial(σ(πd)).
ii. Draw word wn ∼ Multinomial(βcd,zdn
Figure 8 illustrates this process as a graphical model.

).

In this construction, topics βk are drawn as in LDA (Step 1). Corpus-level breaking proportions
v (Step 2) deﬁne a probability distribution on these topics, which indicates their relative prevalence
in the corpus. At the document level, breaking proportions πd create a set of probabilities (Step 3b)
and topic indices cd, drawn from σ(v), attach each document-level stick length to a topic (Step 3a).
This creates a document-level distribution over topics, and words are then drawn as for LDA (Step
3c).

The posterior distribution of the HDP topic model gives a mixed-membership decomposition
of a corpus where the number of topics is unknown in advance and unbounded. However, it is not
possible to compute the posterior. Approximate posterior inference for BNP models in general is
an active ﬁeld of research (Escobar and West, 1995; Neal, 2000; Blei and Jordan, 2006; Teh et al.,
2007).

The advantage of our construction over others is that it meets the conditions of Section 2. All
the complete conditionals are in exponential families in closed form, and it neatly separates global
variables from local variables. The global variables are topics and corpus-level breaking proportions;

8. See the original HDP paper of Teh et al. (2006a) for other constructions of the HDP—the random measure con-
struction, the construction by the Chinese restaurant franchise, and an alternative stick-breaking construction. This
construction was mentioned by Fox et al. (2008). We used it for the HDP in Wang et al. (2011).

29

HOFFMAN, BLEI, WANG, AND PAISLEY

the local variables are document-level topic indices and breaking proportions. Following the same
procedure as for LDA, we now derive stochastic variational inference for the HDP topic model.

Complete conditionals and variational distributions. We form the complete conditional distri-

butions of all variables in the HDP topic model. We begin with the latent indicator variables,

p(zi

p(ck

dn = 1|πd, β1:K , wdn, cd) ∝ exp{log σi(πd) +P∞
di = 1|v, β1:K , wd, zd) ∝ exp{log σk(v) +PN

k=1 ck
n=1 zi

di log βk,wdn},
dn log βk,wdn}.

(36)
(37)

Note the interaction between the two levels of latent indicators. In LDA the ith component of the
topic proportions points to the ith topic. Here we must account for the topic index cdi, which is a
random variable that points to one of the topics.

This interaction between indicators is also seen in the conditionals for the topics,

p(βk|z, c, w) = Dirichlet(cid:16)η +PD

d=1P∞

i=1 ck

diPN

n=1 zi

dnwdn(cid:17) .

The innermost sum collects the sufﬁcient statistics for words in the dth document that are allocated
to the ith local component index. However, these statistics are only kept when the ith topic index
cdi points to the kth global topic.

The full conditionals for the breaking proportions follow those of a standard stick-breaking

construction (Blei and Jordan, 2006),

p(vk|c) = Beta(cid:16)1 +PD
p(πdi|zd) = Beta(cid:16)1 +PN

The complete conditionals for all the latent variables are all in the same family as their cor-
responding distributions in the generative process. Accordingly, we will deﬁne the variational
distributions to be in the same family. However, the main difference between BNP models and
parametric models is that BNP models contain an inﬁnite number of hidden variables. These can-
not be completely represented in the variational distribution as this would require optimizing an
inﬁnite number of variational parameters. We solve this problem by truncating the variational dis-
tribution (Blei and Jordan, 2006). At the corpus level, we truncate at K, ﬁtting posteriors to K
breaking points, K topics, and allowing the topic pointer variables to take on one of K values. At
the document level we truncate at T , ﬁtting T breaking proportions, T topic pointers, and letting
the topic assignment variable take on one of T values. Thus the variational family is,

q(β, v, z, π) =  K
Yk=1

q(βk | λk)q(vk | ak)!  D
Yd=1

T

Yi=1

q(cdi | ζdi)q(πdi | γdi)

q(zdn | φdn)!

N

Yn=1

We emphasize that this is not a ﬁnite model. With truncation levels set high enough, the vari-
ational posterior will use as many topics as the posterior needs, but will not necessarily use all K
topics to explain the observations. (If K is set too small then the truncated variational distribution
will use all of the topics, but this problem can be easily diagnosed and corrected.) Further, a partic-
ular advantage of this two-level stick-breaking distribution is that the document truncation T can be
much smaller than K. Though there may be hundreds of topics in a large corpus, we expect each
document will only exhibit a small subset of them.

30

STOCHASTIC VARIATIONAL INFERENCE

Stochastic variational inference for HDP topic models. From the complete conditionals, batch
variational inference proceeds by updating each variational parameter using the expectation of its
conditional distribution’s natural parameter. In stochastic inference, we sample a data point, update
its local parameters as for batch inference, and then update the global variables.

To update the global topic parameters, we again form intermediate topics with the sampled

document’s optimized local parameters,

ˆλk = η + DPT

di]PN

Eq[ck

i=1

Eq[zi

n=1

We then update the global variational parameters by taking a step in the direction of the stochastic
natural gradient

λ(t+1) = (1 − ρt)λ(t) + ρtˆλk.

This mirrors the update for LDA.

The other global variables in the HDP are the corpus-level breaking proportions vk, each of
which is associated with a set of beta parameters ak = (a(1)
k ) for its variational distribution.
Using the same randomly selected document and optimized variational parameters as above, ﬁrst
construct the two-dimensional vector

ational parameters, and relevant expectations for the full algorithm. Figure 9 gives the stochastic
variational inference algorithm for the HDP topic model.

Stochastic inference versus batch inference for the HDP. Figure 10 illustrates the performance
of the HDP topic model on the same three large collections as in Figure 7. As with LDA, stochastic
variational inference for the HDP converges faster and to a better model.

4. Empirical Study

In this section we study the empirical performance and effectiveness of stochastic variational infer-
ence for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) topic model.
With these algorithms, we can apply and compare these models with very large collections of docu-
ments. We also investigate how the forgetting rate κ and mini-batch size S inﬂuence the algorithms.
Finally, we compare stochastic variational inference to the traditional batch variational inference
algorithm.9

Data. We evaluated our algorithms on three collections of documents. For each collection, we
computed a vocabulary by removing stop words, rare words, and very frequent words. The data are
as follows.

• Nature: This collection contains 350,000 documents from the journal Nature (spanning the
years 1869–2008). After processing, it contains 58M observed words from a vocabulary of
4,200 terms.

9. We implemented all algorithms in Python using the NumPy and SciPy packages, making the implementations as

similar as possible. Links to these implementations are available on the web at
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/topicmodeling.html.

Figure 10: The per-word predictive log likelihood for an HDP model on three large corpora. (Time
is on the square root scale.) As for LDA, stochastic variational inference on the full data
converges faster and to a better place than batch variational inference on a reasonably
sized subset. Section 4 gives the details of our empirical study.

• New York Times: This collection contains 1.8M documents from the New York Times (span-
ning the years 1987–2007). After processing, this data contains 461M observed words from
a vocabulary of 8,000 terms.

• Wikipedia: This collections contains 3.8M documents from Wikipedia. After processing, it

contains 482M observed words from a vocabulary of 7,700 terms.

For each collection, we set aside a test set of 10, 000 documents for evaluating model ﬁtness; these
test sets were not given to the algorithms for training.

Evaluating model ﬁtness. We evaluate how well a model ﬁts the data with the predictive
distribution (Geisser, 1975). We are given a corpus and estimate its topics. We then are given part
of a test document, which we use to estimate that document’s topic proportions. Combining those
topic proportions with the topics, we form a predictive distribution over the vocabulary. Under this
predictive distribution, a better model will assign higher probability to the held-out words.

In more detail, we divide each test document’s words w into a set of observed words wobs and
held-out words who, keeping the sets of unique words in wobs and who disjoint. We approximate the
posterior distribution of topics β implied by the training data D, and then use that approximate pos-
terior to estimate the predictive distribution p(wnew | wobs, D) of a new held-out word wnew from the
test document. Finally, we evaluate the log probability of the words in who under this distribution.

This metric was used in Teh et al. (2007) and Asuncion et al. (2009). Unlike previous methods,
like held-out perplexity (Blei et al., 2003), evaluating the predictive distribution avoids comparing
bounds or forming approximations of the evaluation metric. It rewards a good predictive distribution,
however it is computed.

Operationally, we use the training data to compute variational Dirichlet parameters for the topics.
We then use these parameters with the observed test words wobs to compute the variational distribu-
tion of the topic proportions. Taking the inner product of the expected topics and the expected topic
proportions gives the predictive distribution.

34

STOCHASTIC VARIATIONAL INFERENCE

To see this is a valid approximation, note the following for a K-topic LDA model,

p(wnew | D, wobs) = Z Z (cid:16)PK
≈ Z Z (cid:16)PK
= PK

k=1

k=1 θkβk,wnew(cid:17) p(θ | wobs, β)p(β | D)dθdβ
k=1 θkβkwnew(cid:17) q(θ)q(β)dθdβ

Eq[θk]Eq[βk,wnew],

where q(β) depends on the training data D and q(θ) depends on q(β) and wobs. The metric in-
dependently evaluates each held out word under this distribution.
In the HDP, the reasoning is
identical. The differences are that the topic proportions are computed via the two-level variational
stick-breaking distribution and K is the truncation level of the approximate posterior.

Setting the learning rate.

Stochastic variational inference introduces several parameters in
setting the learning rate schedule (see Equation 28). The forgetting rate κ ∈ (0.5, 1] controls how
quickly old information is forgotten; the delay τ ≥ 0 down-weights early iterations; and the mini-
batch size S is how many documents are subsampled and analyzed in each iteration. Although
stochastic variational inference algorithm converges to a stationary point for any valid κ, τ , and
S, the quality of this stationary point and the speed of convergence may depend on how these
parameters are set.

We set τ = 1 and explored the following forgetting rates and minibatch sizes:10

• Forgetting rate κ ∈ {0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0}

• Minibatch size S ∈ {10, 50, 100, 500, 1000}

We periodically paused each run to compute predictive likelihoods from the test data.

Results on LDA and HDP topic models. We studied LDA and the HDP. In LDA, we varied
the number of topics K to be 25, 50, 100, 200 and 300; we set the Dirichlet hyperparameters
α = 1/K. In the HDP, we set both concentration parameters γ and α equal to 1; we set the top-
level truncation K = 300 and the second level truncation T = 20. (Here T ≪ K because we
do not expect documents to exhibit very many unique topics.) In both models, we set the topic
Dirichlet parameter η = 0.01. Figure 1 shows example topics from the HDP (on New York Times
and Nature).

Figure 11 gives the average predictive log likelihood for both models. We report the value for a
forgetting rate κ = 0.9 and a batch size of 500. Stochastic inference lets us perform a large-scale
comparison of these models. The HDP gives consistently better performance. For larger numbers
of topics, LDA overﬁts the data. As the modeling assumptions promise, the HDP stays robust to
overﬁtting.11 That the HDP outperforms LDA regardless of how many topics LDA uses may be
due in part to the additional modeling ﬂexibility given by the corpus breaking proportions v; these
variables give the HDP the ability to say that certain topics are a priori more likely to appear than
others, whereas the exchangeable Dirichlet prior used in LDA assumes that all topics are equally
common.

10. We also explored various values of the delay τ , but found that the algorithms were not sensitive. To make this

presentaton simpler, we ﬁxed τ = 1 in our report of the empirical study.

11. Though not illustrated, we note that using the traditional measure of ﬁt, held-out perplexity, does not reveal this
overﬁtting (though the HDP still outperforms LDA with that metric as well). We feel that the predictive distribution
is a better metric for model ﬁtness.

Figure 11: Stochastic inference lets us compare performance on several large data sets. We ﬁxed
the forgetting rate κ = 0.9 and the batch size to 500 documents. We ﬁnd that LDA is
sensitive to the number of topics; the HDP gives consistently better predictive perfor-
mance. Traditional variational inference (on subsets of each corpus) did not perform as
well as stochastic inference.

Figure 12: HDP inference: Holding the batch size ﬁxed at 500, we varied the forgetting rate κ.

Slower forgetting rates are preferred.

36

STOCHASTIC VARIATIONAL INFERENCE

Figure 13: HDP inference: Holding the forgetting rate κ ﬁxed at 0.9, we varied the batch size.
Batch sizes may be set too small (e.g., ten documents) but the difference in performance
is small once set high enough.

We now turn to the sensitivity of stochastic inference to its learning parameters. First, we
consider the HDP (the algorithm presented in Figure 9). We ﬁxed the batch size to 500 and explored
the forgetting rate.12 Figure 12 shows the results on all three corpora. All three ﬁts were sensitive
to the forgetting rate; we see that a higher value (i.e., close to one) leads to convergence to a better
local optimum.

Fixing the forgetting rate to 0.9, we explored various mini-batch sizes. Figure 13 shows the
results on all three corpora. Batch sizes that are too small (e.g., ten documents) can affect perfor-
mance; larger batch sizes are preferred. That said, there was not a big difference between batch
sizes of 500 and 1,000. The New York Times corpus was most sensitive to batch size; the Wikipedia
corpus was least sensitive.

Figure 14 and Figure 15 illustrate LDA’s sensitivity to the forgetting rate and batch size, respec-

tively. Again, we ﬁnd that large learning rates and batch sizes perform well.

5. Discussion

We developed stochastic variational inference, a scalable variational inference algorithm that lets
us analyze massive data sets with complex probabilistic models. The main idea is to use stochastic
optimization to optimize the variational objective, following noisy estimates of the natural gradient
where the noise arises by repeatedly subsampling the data. We illustrated this approach with two
probabilistic topic models, latent Dirichlet allocation and the hierarchical Dirichlet process topic
model. With stochastic variational inference, we can easily apply topic modeling to collections of
millions of documents. More importantly, this algorithm generalizes to many settings.

Since developing this algorithm, we have improved on stochastic inference in a number of ways.
In Gopalan et al. (2012), we applied it to the mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel for uncov-
ering overlapping communities in large social networks. This required sampling non-uniformly

12. We ﬁt distributions using the entire grid of parameters described above. However, to simplify presenting results we

will hold one of the parameters ﬁxed and vary the other.

from the data and adjusting the noisy gradient accordingly. In Mimno et al. (2012), we developed a
variant of stochastic inference that combines MCMC for the local updates with stochastic optimiza-
tion for the global updates. In topic modeling this allows for efﬁcient and sparse updates. Finally,
in Ranganath et al. (2013), we developed adaptive learning rates for stochastic inference. These
outperform preset learning-rate schedules and require less hand-tuning by the user.

Stochastic variational inference opens the door to several promising research directions.
We developed our algorithm with conjugate exponential family models. This class of models
is expressive, but nonconjugate models—models where a richer prior is used at the expense of
mathematical convenience—have expanded the suite of probabilistic tools at our disposal. For ex-
ample, nonconjugate models can capture correlations between topics (Blei and Lafferty, 2007) or
topics changing over time (Blei and Lafferty, 2006; Wang et al., 2008), and the general algorithm

38

STOCHASTIC VARIATIONAL INFERENCE

presented here cannot be used in these settings. (In other work, Paisley et al. (2012b) developed
a stochastic variational inference algorithm for a speciﬁc nonconjugate Bayesian nonparametric
model.) Recent research has developed general methods for non-conjugate models (Knowles and Minka,
2011; Gershman et al., 2012; Paisley et al., 2012a; Wang and Blei, 2013). Can these be scaled up
with stochastic optimization?

We developed our algorithm with mean-ﬁeld variational inference and closed form coordinate
updates. Another promising direction is to use stochastic optimization to scale up recent advances in
variational inference, moving beyond closed form updates and fully factorized approximate poste-
riors. As one example, collapsed variational inference (Teh et al., 2006b, 2007) marginalizes out
some of the hidden variables, trading simple closed-form updates for a lower-dimensional pos-
terior. As another example, structured variational distributions relax the mean-ﬁeld approxima-
tion, letting us better approximate complex posteriors such as those arising in time-series mod-
els (Ghahramani and Jordan, 1997; Blei and Lafferty, 2006).

Finally, our algorithm lets us potentially connect innovations in stochastic optimization to better
methods for approximate posterior inference. Wahabzada and Kersting (2011) and Gopalan et al.
(2012) sample from data non-uniformly to better focus on more informative data points. We might
also consider data whose distribution changes over time, such as when we want to model an inﬁnite
stream of data but to “forget” data from the far past in a current estimate of the model. Or we can
study and try to improve our estimates of the gradient. Are there ways to reduce its variance, but
maintain its unbiasedness?

In Section 2, we assumed that we can calculate p(β|x, z), the conditional distribution of the

appendix, we show how to do stochastic variational inference under the weaker assumption that we
can break the global parameter vector β into a set of K subvectors β1:K such that each conditional
distribution p(βk|x, z, β−k) is in a tractable exponential family:

p(βk|x, z, β−k) = h(βk) exp{ηg(x, z, β−k, α)⊤t(βk) − ag(ηg(x, z, β−k, α))}.

We will assign each βk an independent variational distribution so that

We choose each q(βk) to be in the same exponential family as the complete conditional p(βk|x, z, β−k),

q(z, β) = (Qn,j q(zn,j))Qk q(βk).

q(βk) = h(βk) exp{λ⊤

k t(βk) − ag(λk)}.

We overload h(·), t(·), and a(·) so that, for example, q(βk) = p(βk|x, z, β−k) when λk = ηg(x, z, β−k, α).

The natural parameter ηg(x, z, β−k, α) decomposes into two terms,

ηg(x, z, β−k, α) = ηg(β−k, α) +Xn

ηg(xn, zn, β−k, α).

39

HOFFMAN, BLEI, WANG, AND PAISLEY

The ﬁrst depends only on the global parameters β−k and the hyperparameters α; the second is a sum
of N terms that depend on β−k, α, and a single local context (xn, zn).

Proceeding as in Section 2, we will derive the natural gradient of the ELBO implied by this
model and choice of variational distribution. Focusing on a particular βk, we can write the ELBO
as

L = Eq[log p(βk|x, z, β−k)] − Eq[log q(βk)] + const.

= (Eq[ηg(x, z, β−k, α)] − λk)⊤∇λk ag(λk) + ag(λk) + const.

The gradient of L with respect to λk is then

∇λkL = ∇2
λk

ag(λk)(Eq[ηg(x, z, β−k, α)] − λk),

and the natural gradient of L with respect to λk is

ˆ∇λkL = Eq[ηg(x, z, β−k, α)] − λk

= −λk + Eq[ηg(β−k, α)] +Xn

Eq[ηg(xn, zn, β−k, α)].

Randomly sampling a local context (xi, zi) yields a noisy (but unbiased) estimate of the natural
gradient,

ˆ∇λkLi = −λk + Eq[ηg(β−k, α)] + N Eq[ηg(xi, zi, β−k, α)] ≡ −λk + ˆλk.

We can use this noisy natural gradient exactly as in Section 2. For each update t, we sample a context
(xt, zt), optimize the local variational parameters φt by repeatedly applying equation Equation 16,
and take a step of size ρt = (t + τ )−κ in the direction of the noisy natural gradient:

k = (1 − ρt)λ(t−1)
λ(t)

k

+ ρtˆλk

(38)

Note that the update in Equation 38 depends only on λ(t−1); we compute all elements of λ(t) simul-
taneously, whereas in a batch coordinate ascent algorithm λ(t)

k could depend on λ(t)

1:k−1.
