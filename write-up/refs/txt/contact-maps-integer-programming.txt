ABSTRACT  
Motivation.  Protein  contact  map  describes  the  pairwise  spatial  and  functional  relationship  of  residues  in  a  protein  and  contains  key  infor-
mation  for  protein  3D  structure  prediction.  Although  studied  extensively,  it  remains  very  challenging  to  predict  contact  map  using  only  se-
quence information. Most existing methods predict the contact map matrix element-by-element, ignoring correlation among contacts and phys-
ical feasibility of the whole contact map. A couple of recent methods predict contact map  based upon residue co-evolution, taking into consid-
eration contact correlation  and enforcing a sparsity restraint, but these methods  require  a very large number of sequence homologs  for the 
protein under consideration and the resultant contact map may be still physically unfavorable. 

Results.  This paper presents a novel method  PhyCMAP for contact map prediction, integrating both evolutionary and physical restraints by 
machine learning and integer linear programming (ILP). The evolutionary restraints include sequence profile, residue co-evolution and context-
specific statistical potential. The physical restraints specify more concrete relationship among contacts than the sparsity restraint. As such, our 
method greatly reduces the solution space of the contact map matrix and thus, significantly improves prediction accuracy. Experimental results 
confirm that PhyCMAP  outperforms currently popular methods no matter how many sequence homologs are available for the protein under 
consideration. PhyCMAP can predict contacts within minutes after PSIBLAST search for sequence homologs is done, much faster than the 
two recent methods PSICOV and EvFold.

INTRODUCTION 

In this paper we say two residues of a protein are in contact if their Euclidean distance is less than 8Å.  The distance of two residues can be 
calculated  on  Cα  or  Cβ  atoms,  corresponding  to  Cα  or  Cβ  contacts.  A  protein  contact  map  is  a  binary  L×L  matrix  where  L  is  the  protein 
length.  In  this  matrix,  an  element  with  value 1 indicates the  corresponding  two residues  are  in  contact;  otherwise,  not in  contact.  Protein 
contact  map  describes the  pairwise  spatial  and  functional relationship  of  residues in  a  protein. Predicting  contact  map  from  sequence  has 
been an active research topic in recent years partially because contact map is helpful for protein 3D structure prediction  (Ortiz, et al., 1999; 
Vassura, et al., 2008; Vendruscolo, et al., 1997; Wu, et al., 2011)  and protein model quality assessment (Zhou and Skolnick, 2007). Protein 
contact  map  has  also  been  used  for  protein  structure  alignment  and  classification  (Caprara,  et  al.,  2004;  Wang,  et  al.,  2013;  Xu,  et  al., 
2006).   

Many  machine  learning  methods  have  been  developed  for  protein  contact  prediction  in  the  past  decades  (Fariselli  and  Casadio,  1999; 
Göbel, et al., 2004; Olmea and Valencia, 1997; Punta and Rost, 2005; Vendruscolo and Domany, 1998; Vullo, et al., 2006). For example, 
SVMSEQ (Wu and Zhang, 2008) and SVMcon (Cheng and Baldi, 2007) use support vector machines; NNcon (Tegge, et al., 2009) uses a 
recursive neural network; Distill (Baú, et al., 2006) uses a 2-dimensional recursive neural network; and CMAPpro (Di Lena, et al., 2012) 
uses a multi-layer neural network. Although very different, these methods are common in that they predict the contact map matrix element-
by-element,  ignoring  the  correlation  among  contacts  and  also  physical  feasibility  of  the  whole  contact  map  (physical  constraints  are  not 
totally independent of contact correlation). A special type of physical constraint is that a contact map matrix must be sparse, i.e., the num-
ber of contacts in a protein is only linear in its length. 

Two recent methods (PSICOV (Jones, et al., 2012) and Evfold (Morcos, et al., 2011)) predict contacts using only residue co-evolution in-
formation derived from sequence homologs and enforcing the above-mentioned sparsity constraint. However, both of them require a large 
number (at least several hundreds) of sequence homologs for the protein under prediction. This  makes the predicted contacts not very use-
ful in real-world protein modeling since a (globular) protein with many sequence homologs usually has very similar templates in PDB and 
thus, template-based models are of good quality and cannot be further improved by predicted contacts. Conversely, a protein without close 
templates  in  PDB,  which  may  benefit  from  contact  prediction,  usually  has  very  few  sequence  homologs.  Further, these  two  methods  en-
force  only  a  very  simple  sparsity  constraint  (i.e.,  the  total  number  of  contacts  in  a  protein  is  small),  ignoring  many  more  concrete  con-
straints. To name a few, one residue can have only a small number of contacts, depending on its  secondary structure and neighboring resi-
dues. The number of contacts between two beta strands is bounded by the strand length. 

Astro-Fold (Klepeis and Floudas, 2003) possibly is the first contact prediction method that makes use of physical constraints, which imply 
the sparsity constraint used by PSICOV and Evfold. However, some of the physical constraints are too restrictive and possibly unrealistic. 
For example, it requires that a residue in one beta strand can only be in contact with one residue in another beta strand. More importantly, 
Astro-Fold does not make use of evolutionary information and thus, significantly reduces its prediction accuracy.  

In  this  paper,  we present  a novel  method  PhyCMAP  for  contact  map  prediction  by  integrating  both  evolutionary  and physical  constraints 
using  machine learning (i.e.,  Random  Forests)  and  integer linear  programming  (ILP).  PhyCMAP  first  predicts the  probability  of  any  two

residues forming a contact using both evolutionary and non-evolutionary information. Then, PhyCMAP infers a given number of top con-
tacts based upon predicted contact probabilities by enforcing a set of realistic physical constraints, which specify more concrete relationship 
among  contacts  and  also  imply  the  sparsity  restraint  used  by  PSICOV  and  Evfold.  By  combining  both  evolutionary  and  physical  con-
straints, our method greatly reduces the solution space of a contact map and leads to much better prediction accuracy. Experimental results 
confirm that PhyCMAP outperforms currently popular methods no matter how many sequence homologs are available for the protein under 
prediction. 

2  METHODS 

Overview.  As shown  in  Figure  1,  our  method  consists  of  several key  components.  First,  we  employ  Random  Forests  (RF)  to predict the 
contact  probability  of  any  two  residues  from  both evolutionary  and non-evolutionary  information.  Then  we  employ  an integer linear  pro-
gramming  (ILP)  method  to  select  a  set  of  top  contacts  by  maximizing  their  accumulative  probabilities  subject  to  a  set  of  physical  con-
straints, which are represented as linear constraints. The resultant top contacts form a physically  favorable contact map for the protein un-
der consideration.

2.1  Predicting contact probability by Random Forests 

We  use  Random  Forests (RF) to  predict the  probability  of  any  two 
residues  forming  a  contact  from  several  types  of  information:  1) 
evolutionary  information  from  a  single  protein  family,  e.g.,  PSI-
BLAST  sequence  profile  (Altschul  and  Koonin,  1998)  and  two 
types  of  mutual  information;  2)  non-evolutionary  information  de-
rived from the solved protein structures, e.g., residue contact poten-
tial; 3)  mixed information  from  the  above two  sources,  e.g.,  EPAD  (a  context-specific  distance-based  statistical  potential) (Zhao and  Xu, 
2012),  secondary  structure  predicted  by  PSIPRED  (Jones,  1999),  and  homologous  pairwise  contact  score;  and  4)  amino  acid  physic-
chemical properties. Some features are calculated on the residues in a local window of size 5 centered at the residues under consideration. 
In  total  there  are  ~300  features  for  each  residue  pair.  We  trained  our  RF  model  using  the  RandomForest  package  in  R  (Breiman,  2001; 
Liaw and Wiener, 2002) and selected the model parameters by 5-fold cross validation. Below we briefly explain some important features. 

 
Figure  2. The contrastive mutual information (lower triangle) and 
mutual  information  (upper  triangle)  of  protein  1j8bA.The  native 
contacts  are  represented  by  boxes.  The  big  yellow  and  red  boxes 
contain a group of medium-range and long-range contacts, respec-
tively. 

Sequence profile. The position-specific mutation scores at residues i and j and their neighboring residues are used. 

Contrastive mutual information (CMI). Let mi,j denote the mutual information (MI) between two residues i and j, which can be calculat-
ed from the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of all the sequence homologs. We define the contrastive mutual information (CMI) as the 
MI difference between one residue pair and all of its neighboring pairs, which can be calculated as follows. 

The  CMI  measures  how the  co-mutation strength  of  one  residue pair differs  from its  neighboring  pairs.  By  using  CMI  instead  of  MI,  we 
can remove the background bias of MI in a local region, as shown in Figure 2. When only a small number of sequence homologs are avail-
able  (or  at  some  conserved  positions  with entropy  <0.3),  we  may have  very  low MI,  which  may  result  in artificially  high  CMI.  To  avoid 
this, we directly set the CMI in these situations to 0. 
 
Mutual information for the chaining effect of residue coupling. When residue A has strong interaction with B and B has strong 
interaction with residue C, it is likely that residue A also has interaction with C. To account for this kind of chaining effect of 
residue coupling, we use the powers of the MI matrix. In particular, we use MIk where k ranges from 2 to 11 to capture this 
kind of chaining effect. When there are many sequence homologs (i.e., MI is accurate), this kind of MI powers greatly im-
proves medium- and long-range contact prediction (see Results for details).

Residue contact potential.  We use residue contact-based potential described in (Tan, et al., 2006) 

EPAD. It is a context-specific distance-dependent statistical potential (Zhao and Xu, 2012), derived from protein evolutionary information 
and  solved  protein  structures  in  PDB.  The Cα  and  Cβ  atomic  interaction  potential  at  all  the  distance  bins  is  used  as  features.  The  atomic 
distance is discretized into bins by 1Å and all the distance>15Å is grouped into a single bin. 

Homologous pairwise contact score (HPS). This score quantify the probability of a residue pair forming a contact between two secondary 
structures. Let PSbeta (a, b) denote the probability of two amino acids a and b forming a beta contact. Let PShelix (a, b) denote the probability 
of two amino acids a and b forming a helix contact. Both PSbeta (a, b) and PShelix (a, b) are derived from a simple statistics on PDB25. Let H 
denote the set of sequence homologs of the protein under consideration. Let i and j denote two positions in the multiple sequence alignment 
of the homologs. We calculate the homologous pairwise contact score HPS for the two positions 

 as follows.

The variables. Let i and j denote residue positions and L the protein length. Let u and v index secondary structure segments of a protein. 
Let Begin(u) and End(u) denote the first and last residues of the segment u and SSeg(u) the set 
 . Let SStype(u) 

denote the secondary structure type of one residue or one segment u. Let Len(u) denote the length of the segment u. We use the binary vari-
ables in Table 1.

The objective function. Intuitively we shall choose those contacts with the highest probability predicted by our Random Forest model, i.e., 
the  objective  function  shall  be the sum  of  predicted  probabilities  of  the  selected  contacts.  However,  the  selected  contacts  shall  also mini-
mize the violation of the physical constraints. To enforce this, we use a vector of relaxation variables R to measure the degree to which all 
the soft constraints are violated. Thus, our objective function is as follows.  

 

Where 

 is the contact probability predicted by our Random Forest model for two residues and 

is a linear penalty function 

where r run over all the soft constraints. The relaxation variables will be further explained in the following section. 

The constraints. We use both soft and hard constraints. There is a single relaxation variable for each group of soft constraint, but the hard 
constraints are strictly enforced. We penalize the violation of soft constraints by incorporating the relaxation variables to the objective func-
tion. The constraints in groups 1, 2, and 6 are soft constraints. Those in groups 3, 4, 5 and 7 are hard constraints, some of which are similar 
to what are used by Astro-Fold (Klepeis and Floudas, 2003). 

Group 1. This group of soft constraints bound from above the total number of contacts that can be formed  by a single residue i (in a sec-
ondary structure type s1) with all the other residues in a secondary structure type s2.

Group 2. This group of constraints bound the total number of contacts between two strands sharing at least one contact. Let 
note two beta strands.  We have

The  two  constraints  are  explained  in  Figure  3  as  follows.  Figure  3(A)  shows  that  the  total  number  of  contacts  between  two  beta  strands 
. One group is due to beta strand pairs forming a beta sheet. The other may be due to 
diverges into two groups when 

incorrectly predicted beta strands or beta strand pairs not in a beta sheet. Figure 3(B) shows that the total number of contacts between a pair 
of beta strands has an upper bound proportional to the length of the longer beta strand. Since there are points below the  skew line in Figure 
3(A),  which  indicate  that  a  beta strand pair  may  have  fewer than  
 to the 

 contacts,  we  add  a  relaxation  variable 

lower bound constraints in Group 2. Similarly, we use a relaxation variable 

 for the upper bound constraints.

Training  data.  It  consists  of  900  non-redundant  protein  structures,  any  two  of  which  share  no  more  than  25%  sequence  identity.  Since 
there  are  far  fewer  contacts  than  non-contacts,  we use  all the  contacts  and  randomly  sample  only  20%  of the non-contacts  as  the training 
data. All the training proteins are selected before CASP10 (the 10th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) started in May 2012.  

Test data I: CASP10. This set contains 123 CASP10 targets with publicly available native structures. Meanwhile, 36 of them are classified 
as  hard  targets  because  the  top  half  of  their  submitted  models  have  average  TMscore<0.5.  When  they  were  just  released,  most  of  the 
CASP10 targets share low sequence identity (<25%) with the proteins in PDB. BLAST indicates that there are only 5 short CASP10 targets 
(~50 residues) which have sequence identity slightly above 30% with our training proteins. 

Test  data  II:  Set600.  This  set  contains  601  proteins  randomly  extracted  from  PDB25  (Brenner,  et  al.,  2000) and  was  constructed  before 
CASP10 started. They have the following properties: 1) less than 25% sequence identity with the training proteins; 2) each protein has at 
least 50 residues and an  X-ray  structure  with resolution better than  1.9Å;  3)  each  protein  has at least  5 residues  with  predicted secondary 
structure being alpha-helix or beta-strand.  

Both  the  training  set  and  Set600  are  sampled  from  PDB25 (Wang  and  Dunbrack, 2003),  in  which  any  two  proteins  share less than 25% 
sequence identity. Sequence identity is calculated using the method in (Brenner, et al., 2000).  

Programs  to  be  compared. We  compare  our  method,  denoted  as PhyCMAP,  with  four  state-of-the-art  methods:  CMAPpro  (Di  Lena,  et 
al.,  2012),  NNcon  (Tegge,  et  al.,  2009),  PSICOV  (Jones,  et  al.,  2012)  and  Evfold  (Morcos,  et  al.,  2011).  We  run  NNCon,  PSICOV  and 
Evfold locally and CMAPpro by its web server. We do not compare our method with Astro-Fold because it is not publicly available. Since 
Astro-Fold does not make use of any evolutionary information, it does not perform well for many proteins. 

Evaluation  methods.  Depending  on  the  chain  distance  of  the two  residues, there  are  three kinds  of  contacts:  short-range,  medium-range 
and long-range. Short-range contacts are closely related to local conformation and are relatively easy to predict. Medium-range and long-
range contacts determine the overall shape of a protein and are more challenging to predict. We evaluate prediction accuracy using the top 
5, L/10, L/5 predicted contacts where L is the protein length. 

Meff: the number of non-redundant sequence homologs. Given a target protein and the multiple sequence alignment of all of its homo-
logs, we measure the number of non-redundant sequence homologs by Meff as follows. 

 

                                  (1) 

Where both i and j go over all the sequence homologs and Si,j is a binary similarity value between two proteins. Following Evfold (Morcos, 
et al., 2011), we compute the similarity of two sequence homologs using their hamming distance. That is,  Si,j is 1 if the normalized ham-
ming distance is < 0.3; 0 otherwise.

Performance on the CASP10 set. As shown in Table 3, tested on the whole CASP10 set, our PhyCMAP significantly exceeds the 2nd best 
method  CMAPpro  in  terms  of  the  accuracy  of  the  top  5,  L/10  and  L/5  predicted  contacts.  The  advantage  of  PhyCMAP  over  CMAPpro 
becomes  smaller  but  still  substantial  when  short-range  contacts  are  excluded  from  consideration.  PhyCMAP  significantly  outperforms 
NNcon,  PSICOV  and  Evfold  no  matter  how  the  performance  is  evaluated.  Figure  4  shows  the  head-to-head  comparison  between  Phy-
CMAP and CMAPpro and PSICOV for long-range contact prediction.

Performance  on  the  36  hard  CΑSP10 targets. As shown in Table 4, tested on the 36 hard CASP10 targets our PhyCMAP exceeds the 
2nd  best  method  CMAPpro  by  5-7%  in terms  of  the  accuracy  of  the top  5,  L/10  and  L/5  predicted  contacts.  The advantage  of  PhyCMAP 
over  CMAPpro  becomes  smaller  but  still  substantial  when  short-range  contacts  are excluded  from  consideration.  PhyCMAP  significantly 
outperforms NNcon, PSICOV and Evfold no matter how many predicted contacts are evaluated. PSICOV and Evfold almost fail on these 
hard CASP10 targets. By contrast, CMAPpro, NNcon and PhyCMAP still can correctly predict some contacts. Figure 5 shows the head-to-
head comparison of PhyCMAP, CMAPpro and PSICOV for medium- and long-range contact prediction.

Note that both PSICOV and Evfold, two recent methods receiving a lot of attentions from the community, do not perform very well on the 
CASP10  set.  This is  partially  because they  require  a large  number  of  sequence  homologs  for  the  protein  under  prediction.  Nevertheless, 
most  of  the  CASP targets,  especially  the  hard  ones, do  not  satisfy  this  requirement  because  a protein  with so  many  homologs  very  likely 
has highly similar templates in PDB and thus, was not used as a CASP target. 

Prediction accuracy  vs. the number  of sequence  homologs.  We divide the 123 CASP10 targets into 5 groups according to their logMeff 
values:  [0,2),  [2,4),  [4,6),  [6,8),  [8,10],  which  contain  19,  17,  25,  36  and  26  targets,  respectively.  Meanwhile  Meff  is  the  number  of  non-
redundant sequence homologs for the protein under consideration (see Methods for definition). Only medium- and long-range contacts are 
considered here. Figure 6 clearly shows that the prediction accuracy increases with respect to Meff. The more non-redundant homologs are 
available, the better prediction accuracy can be achieved by  PhyCMAP, Evfold and PSICOV. However, CMAPpro and NNCON have de-
creased  accuracy  when logMeff >8.  Figure  6  also  shows that  PhyCMAP  outperforms Evfold,  CMAPpro  and  NNCON across  all Meff.  Phy-
CMAP greatly  outperforms PSICOV in predicting Cα contacts regardless of Meff and also in predicting Cβ contacts when logMeff ≤ 6. Phy-
CMAP is comparable to PSICOV in predicting Cβ contacts when logMeff >6.

Performance  on  Set600.  To  fairly  compare  our  method  with  Evfold  (Morcos,  et  al.,  2011)  and  PSICOV  (Jones,  et  al.,  2012),  both  of 
which  require  a  large  number  of  sequence  homologs,  we  divide  Set600  into  two  subsets  based  upon  Meff,  the  number  of  non-redundant 
sequence homologs. The first subset contains 471 proteins with Meff>100 (see Methods for definition). Each protein in this subset has >500 
sequence  homologs,  which  satisfies  the  requirement  of  PSICOV.  The  2nd  subset  is  more  challenging,  containing  130  proteins  with  Meff 
≤100. As shown in Table 5, even on the 1st subset, PhyCMAP still exceeds PSICOV and Evfold, although the advantage over PSICOV is 
not  substantial  for  Cβ  contact prediction  when  short-range  contacts  are  excluded  from  consideration.  PhyCMAP  also  outperforms  NNcon 
and CMAPpro on this set. As shown in Table 6, on the 2nd subset PhyCMAP significantly outperforms PSICOV and is slightly better than 
CMAPpro  and  NNcon.  Figures 7 and  8  show the  head-to-head  comparison  of  PhyCMAP,  PSICOV  and  CMAPpro.  As shown in  the  fig-
ures, when Meff>100, PhyCMAP outperforms CMAPpro on most test proteins; when Meff≤100, PhyCMAP outperforms both CMAPpro and 

7 

 Z. Wang et al. 

PSICOV  on  most  test  proteins.  These  results  again  confirm  that  our  method  applies  to  a  protein  without  many  sequence  homologs,  on 
which PSICOV and Evfold usually fail.

Note that CMAPpro used Astral 1.73 (Brenner, et al., 2000; Di Lena, et al., 2012) as its training set, which shares >90% sequence identity 
with 226 proteins in Set600 (180 with Meff>100 and 46 with Meff ≤100). To more fairly compare the prediction methods, we exclude the 226 
proteins from Set600 that share >90% sequence identity with the CMAPpro training set. Here the sequence identity is calculated using CD-
HIT (Li and Godzik, 2006; Li, et al., 2001). This results in a set of 291 proteins with Meff > 100 and 84 proteins Meff ≤100. Table 7 shows 
that  PhyCMAP  greatly  outperforms  CMAPpro  and Evfold  on  the reduced dataset.  PhyCMAP  also  outperforms  PSICOV  in  predicting  Cα 
contacts, but is slightly worse in predicting long-range Cβ contacts.

Contribution of contrastive mutual information and pairwise contact scores 

The  contrastive  mutual  information  (CMI)  and  homologous  pairwise  contact  scores  (HPS) help  improve  the performance  of  our  random 
forest model. Table 8 shows their contribution to the prediction accuracy on the 471 proteins (with Meff >100) in Set600.

are observed for Cα contact prediction.

The powers of the MI matrix greatly improve long-range contact prediction when many sequence homologs are available, as shown in Ta-
ble  9.  The  average  accuracy  is  computed  on  the  Set600  proteins  with  Meff>100  excluding  those  with  >90%  sequence  identify  with  As-
tral1.73. Figure 9 shows gain from using the powers of the MI matrix for each test protein. This result indicates that it is important to con-

 Z. Wang et al. 

sider the chaining effect of residue couplings for medium- and long-range contacts and the powers of the MI matrix are good measure of 
the chaining effect. It is also worth to mention that we can calculate the powers of the MI matrix quickly, much faster than calculating the 
matrix inverse (as done by PSICOV).

Contribution of physical constraints 

 

 

Table 10 shows the improvement resulting from the physical constraints (i.e., the ILP method) over the Random Forests (RF) method on 
Set600. On the 471 proteins with Meff>100, ILP improves medium- and long-range contact prediction, but not short-range contact predic-
tion. This result confirms that the physical constraints used by our ILP method indeed capture some global properties of a protein contact 
map. The improvement resulting from the physical constraints is larger on the 130 proteins with Meff ≤100. In particular, the improvement 
on short-range contacts is substantial. These results may imply that when homologous information is sufficient, we can predict short-range 
contacts very accurately and thus, cannot further improve the prediction by the physical constraints. When homologous information is in-
sufficient for accurate contact prediction, we can improve the prediction using the physical constraints, which are complementary to evolu-
tionary information.

Specific Examples 

 We  show  the  contact  prediction  results  of  four  CASP10  targets  T0677D2,  T0693D2,  T0756D1  and  T0701D1  in Figure  10,  Figure 101, 
Figure 12, and Figure 13, respectively. T0677D2 does not have many sequence homologs (Meff=31.53). As shown in Figure 10, our predic-
tion  matches  well  with the  native  contacts.  PhyCMAP  has top  L/5  prediction  accuracy  0.357  on  medium-  and long-range  contacts  while 
Evfold  cannot  correctly  predict  any  contacts.  T0693D2  has  many  sequence  homologs  with  Meff=2208.39.  As  shown  in  Figure  11,  Phy-
CMAP does well in predicting the long-distance contacts around the residue pair (20,100). For this target, PhyCMAP and Evfold obtain top 
L/5  prediction  accuracy  of  0.628  and  0.419,  respectively,  when  both  medium-  and  long-range  contacts  are  considered.  In  Figure  12, 
T0756D1  has  many  sequence  homologs  with  Meff  =  1824.46.  The accuracy  of  the top  L/5  predicted  contacts  by  our  PhyCMAP  is  0.944, 
while the accuracy by Evfold is 0.500. In Figure 13, T0701D1 has a large number of sequence homologs with Meff = 3300.02, the accuracy

4  CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSIONS 

This paper has presented a novel method for protein contact map prediction by integrating evolutionary information, non-evolutionary in-
formation  and  physical  constraints  using  machine  learning  and  integer  linear  programming.  Our  method  differs  from  currently  popular 
contact  prediction  methods  in  that  we  enforce  a  few  physical  constraints,  which  imply  the  sparsity  constraint   (used  by  PSICOV  and 
Evfold), to the whole contact map and take into consideration  contact correlation. Our method also differs from the first-principle method 
(e.g., Astro-Fold) in that we exploit evolutionary information from several aspects (e.g., two types of mutual information, context-specific 
distance potential and sequence profile) to significantly improve prediction accuracy. Experimental results confirm that our method outper-
forms  existing  popular  machine  learning  methods  (e.g.,  CMAPpro  and  NNCON)  and  two  recent  residue  co-evolution  methods  PSICOV 
and Evfold regardless of the number of sequence homologs available for the protein under consideration.  

The study of our method indicates that the physical constraints are helpful for contact prediction, especially when the protein under consid-
eration  does  not  have  many  sequence  homologs.  Nevertheless,  the  physical  constraints  used  by  our  current  method  do  not  cover  all  the 
properties  of  a  protein  contact  map.  To  further  improve  prediction  accuracy  on  medium and long-range  contact  prediction,  we  may  take 
into consideration global properties of a protein distance matrix. For example, the pairwise distances of any three residues shall satisfy the 
triangle inequality. Some residues also have correlated pairwise distances. To enforce this kind of distance constraints, we shall introduce 
distance  variables  and  also  define  their  relationship  with  contact  variables.  By  introducing  distance  variables,  we  may  also  optimize  the 
distance probability, as opposed to the contact probability used by our current ILP method. Further, we can also introduce variables of beta-
sheet (group of beta-strands) to capture more global properties of a contact map.  

One may ask how our approach compares to a model-based filtering strategy in which 3D models are built based on initial predicted con-
tacts and then used to filter incorrect predictions. Our method differs from this general “model-based filtering” strategy in a couple of as-
pects. First, it is time-consuming to build thousands or at least hundreds of 3D models with initial predicted contacts. In contrast, our meth-
od  can  do  contact  prediction  (using  physical  constraints)  within  minutes  after  PSI-BLAST  search  is  done.  Second, the quality  of  the  3D 
models is also determined by other factors such as energy function and energy optimization (or conformation sampling) methods  while our 
method is independent of these factors. Even if the energy function is very accurate, the energy optimization algorithm often is trapped to 
local  minima  because the energy  function  is  not  rugged.  That is,  the  3D  models  resulting  from  energy  minimization are biased  towards a 
specific region of the conformation space, unless an extremely large scale of conformation sampling is conducted. Therefore, the predicted 
contacts  derived  from  these  models  may  also  suffer  from  this  “local  minima”  issue.  By  contrast,  our  integer  programming  method  can 
search through  the  whole  conformation  space and  find the  global optimal solution  and  thus, is  not  biased to any  local  minima region.  By 
using  our  predicted  contacts  as  constraints,  we  may  pinpoint  to  the  good  region  of  a  conformation  space  (without  being  biased  by  local 
minima), reduce the search space and significantly speed up conformation search.
