CONSPECTUS: The design and study of miniproteins, that
is, polypeptide chains <40 amino acids in length that adopt
deﬁned and stable 3D structures, is resurgent. Miniproteins
oﬀer possibilities for reducing the complexity of larger proteins
and so present new routes to studying sequence-to-structure
and sequence-to-stability relationships in proteins generally.
They also provide modules for protein design by pieces and, with
this, prospects for building more-complex or even entirely new
protein structures.
In addition, miniproteins are useful
scaﬀolds for
for example,
those involved in protein−protein interactions, catalysis, and biomolecular binding,
biotechnology and medicine.
Here we select examples from almost four decades of miniprotein design, development, and dissection. Simply because of the
word limit for this Account, we focus on miniproteins that are cooperatively folded monomers in solution and not stabilized by
cross-linking or metal binding. In these cases, the optimization of noncovalent interactions is even more critical for the
maintenance of the folded states than in larger proteins. Our chronology and catalogue highlights themes in miniproteins, which
we explore further and begin to put on a ﬁrmer footing through an analysis of the miniprotein structures that have been
deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) thus far.
Speciﬁcally, and compared with larger proteins, miniproteins generally have a lower proportion of residues in regular secondary
structure elements (α helices, β strands, and polyproline-II helices) and, concomitantly, more residues in well-structured loops.
This allows distortions of the backbone enabling mini-hydrophobic cores to be made. This also contrasts with larger proteins,
which can achieve hydrophobic cores through tertiary contacts between distant regions of sequence. On average, miniproteins
have a higher proportion of aromatic residues than larger proteins, and speciﬁcally electron-rich Trp and Tyr, which are often
found in combination with Pro and Arg to render networks of CH−π or cation−π interactions. Miniproteins also have a higher
proportion of the long-chain charged amino acids (Arg, Glu, and Lys), which presumably reﬂects salt-bridge formation and their
greater surface area-to-volume ratio. Together, these amino-acid preferences appear to support greater densities of noncovalent
interactions in miniproteins compared with larger proteins.
We anticipate that with recent developments such as parametric protein design, it will become increasingly routine to use
computation to generate and evaluate models for miniproteins in silico ahead of experimental studies. This could include
accessing new structures comprising secondary structure elements linked in previously unseen conﬁgurations. The improved
understanding of the noncovalent interactions that stabilize the folded states of such miniproteins that we are witnessing through
both in-depth bioinformatics analyses and experimental testing will feed these computational protein designs. With this in mind,
we can expect a new and exciting era for miniprotein design, study, and application.

■ INTRODUCTION

Polypeptide chains fold into myriad three-dimensional shapes
determined by their amino acid sequences. Currently, there are
approaching 120 000 protein structures in the Protein Data
Bank (PDB), the chains of which adopt over 1300 distinct folds
and have an average length of 800 residues. Understanding this
process is known as the protein-folding problem,1 which has
three aspects: How do proteins fold mechanistically? How do
proteins fold in vivo? And, what information in the amino-acid
sequence encodes 3D structure and function?2 These are
complex problems because the folded states are determined by

the interplay of many weak noncovalent interactions between
thousands of atoms.3 Moreover, the entropic cost of folding
protein chains is only just outweighed by the enthalpy of
forming these interactions making folded proteins only
marginally stable. One way to address these various aspects
of
to study so-called
miniproteins where complexity is reduced, providing accessible

platforms for dissecting contributions to protein folding and
stability both in silico and in vitro.4,5
Here we deﬁne miniproteins as short proteins of ≤40 amino
acids with well-deﬁned folds consisting of
two or more
secondary structure elements, sequestered hydrophobic cores,
and cooperative folding. Standalone, small and cooperatively
folded secondary structures exist, for example, single α-helical
peptides;6 however these lack the hydrophobic cores typical of
globular proteins. This deﬁnition resonates with the concept of
foldamers more generally.7

The small size of miniproteins necessarily means smaller
hydrophobic cores and fewer noncovalent interactions than
found in proteins generally. Therefore, many miniproteins are
stabilized by metal binding or covalent cross-linking;
for
example, EF hands,8 zinc ﬁngers,9 and cysteine-knot peptides.10
Here, we focus on water-soluble and largely monomeric
miniproteins stabilized solely by noncovalent interactions and
without bound metals or covalent cross-links, although we
recognize that great strides have been and continue to be made
with these miniproteins more generally.11,12 We give a brief
history of the subﬁeld, highlight key examples and themes in
more detail, and tease out
rules for miniprotein design
supported by an analysis of the PDB. Finally, we discuss
potential applications and outlook for miniproteins.

Many of

the miniproteins described over the last

four
decades are fragments of larger globular proteins and have been
subject
to iterative redesign and optimization to enhance
function.5,13−15 Successes in this have

to miniprotein design.16,17 This starts with fragment-based

protein folding.

■ A CHRONOLOGY AND COLLECTION OF

MINIPROTEINS

Pancreatic Polypeptides
The polyproline-II−loop−α-helix fold was ﬁrst observed in the
X-ray crystal structure of avian pancreatic peptide hormone
(aPP) dimer.18 This compact
stabilized by the
interdigitation of proline residues from the polyproline-II
helix with aromatic residues presented by the α helix to form a
hydrophobic core; in addition, π-stacking interactions stabilize
the dimer interface, Figure 1. Recently, we have designed a
monomeric 34-residue miniprotein with the same overall
topology of the pancreatic polypeptides,19 which we call PPα
and discuss later, Figures 2A and 3.

in aPP facilitates

Directed evolution of synthetic aPP monomers has been
used to develop miniprotein-based ligands as therapeutics.
Optimization of the polyproline-II helix in aPP gave a variant
with high aﬃnity for the ActA target protein in Listeria
monocytogenes, EVH1 mena1−112. Importantly, the miniprotein
discriminates between paralogs and reduces bacterial motility.13
A similar strategy has been used to optimize the α-helix of aPP
for sequence-speciﬁc DNA recognition,14 and the introduction
of arginine residues
the
miniprotein into cells.20 Artiﬁcial esterases have also been
developed by grafting catalytic residues onto the solvent-
exposed α helix of bovine pancreatic polypeptide, bPP.21
ββα Folds and Metal-Free Zinc Fingers
Small, independent ββα units are best exempliﬁed by DNA-
binding zinc ﬁngers. These were ﬁrst identiﬁed in transcription
factor IIIA from Xenopus oocytes, and an NMR structure
determined for the Xﬁn domain followed.23 The fold, which
comprises a β hairpin, a connecting loop, and an α helix, is not
driven by the conserved hydrophobic core but by the binding of
zinc usually through His2Cys2 motifs. The development and
modular assembly of metal-binding zinc-ﬁnger domains has
created artiﬁcial proteins and enzymes that can recognize
deﬁned regions of DNA for the activation, repression, or
alteration of user-speciﬁed genes and has contributed early in
the development of genome editing.24

Regarding metal-free designs, a 23-residue monomeric
structure has been achieved through iterative design enhancing
a hydrophobic core, α-helix structure, and inclusion of a

suitable turn.25 A computational design has produced a weakly
cooperatively folded peptide with a midpoint of unfolding (TM)
of 39 °C.26 The broad transition is consistent with a low
enthalpy of folding expected for a small hydrophobic core.
Villin Headpiece
Another approach to miniprotein design is to pare down larger
natural proteins. The Villin headpiece, a 35-residue fragment of
folds in water.27 The NMR
the chicken protein (HP-35),
ensemble reveals three α-helical segments with each helix
contributing residues to a central hydrophobic core.27 HP-35 is
surprisingly thermostable with a TM of 70 °C.28
β-Hairpins and Trp-Zippers
Early examples of free-standing β-structures based on natural
fragments were only moderately folded in fully aqueous
media.32,33 However, designed Trp-zippers are well-folded
examples of short (12−16 residues) de novo β hairpins with
interlocked tryptophans and right-handed highly twisted
strands, Figure 2D.29 They have exceptional thermal stabilities
and reversible cooperative unfolding.

Trp-pocket β hairpins are stabilized via cation−π interactions
in which a single Lys packs against a diTrp cleft on the opposite
strand.34 Some 12-residue Trp-pockets are fully folded34 and
resist degradation,35 making them the most stable β hairpins
reported.

From a wealth of studies, reliable guidelines for the design,
optimization, and stabilization of monomeric β-hairpins include
a hydrophobic cluster on one surface of the hairpin and close to
the loop;36 interstrand side-chain interactions, particularly
Trp−Trp;29,37 high turn and β-sheet propensities;38 and
charged or aromatic residues or β-capping motifs to secure
the termini via cross-strand interactions.39
Designed Three-Stranded β-Sheets
A challenge in the design of isolated β-sheets is to avoid β-
amyloid-like assemblies.40 Some tentative three-stranded
antiparallel β-sheets have been achieved in aqueous methanol
by appending strands onto β-hairpins.41 An early NMR

route to β-sheet
miniproteins. WW domains are natural antiparallel 3-stranded
β sheets, named after the two conserved Trp residues in the
ﬁrst and third β strands.44 X-ray crystal structures of two
shorter (34 and 37 residues) natural WW domains followed, in
addition to that for a designed 33-residue prototype, Figure
2E.30 Natural WW domains have been engineered for
alternative functions,
the incorporation of a
DNA binding pocket,15 and for probing carbohydrate−
aromatic packing interactions.5
Trp-Cage
The Trp-cage is a 20-residue miniprotein from the gila monster
extendin-4.45 The original truncation is only folded in aqueous
triﬂuoroethanol.45 However, NMR structures of variants show a
well-ordered fold comprising an α helix followed by a well-
structured loop, with a hydrophobic core centered on a single
Trp residue buttressed by Pro side chains, Figure 2F.31 Owing
to its small size and wealth of experimental data now available,
the Trp-cage has become a paradigm for experimental and
computational miniprotein folding.46
βαβ Designs
(βα)n repeats occur widely in natural proteins, for example,
TIM barrels, the Rossmann fold, and Leucine Rich Repeats.
The alternating secondary structure elements lead to parallel β-
sheets. The ﬁrst de novo designed, standalone, water-soluble
βαβ unit comprises a 12-residue α helix paired with two 5-
residue β strands via a small hydrophobic core.47 Although
initial designs were molten globule, a folded state has been
stabilized by installing a Trp-zip-like Trp pair in the β-strands.29
An NMR structure of the resulting 36-residue βαβ construct
(Figure 2G) conﬁrms face-to-face packing of the installed pair.
The miniprotein is highly stable up to temperatures of 90 °C,
which is remarkable for a small miniprotein with only
proteinogenic amino acids and without covalent cross-links.
TrpPlexus
The ﬁrst miniprotein comprising a β-strand and a polyproline-
II helix has been achieved through a fragment-based design,
Figure 2H.22 TrpPlexus combines a short, Arg-rich, N-terminal
β strand, and a C-terminal polyproline-II helix that is free of
Pro but rich in Trp in a WSXWS motif. These are borrowed
from a ﬁbronectin III binding domain, and linked by a D-Pro-
Gly loop to give a 19-residue construct. NMR spectroscopy
shows the Arg and Trp residues interdigitate to form a
cation−π network.22 A disulﬁde-cyclized TrpPlexus tolerates N-
substituted Gly and Pro residues in the polyproline-II helix,
opening up potential for proteinogenic and peptoid side-chain
placements for peptidomimetic inhibitors of protein−protein
interactions.48
PPα
Recently we combined fragment-based and rational design to
create the monomeric miniprotein PPα.19 PPα has a polypro-
line-II helix−loop−α-helix topology that
is stabilized by
interdigitation of Pro residues of the polyproline helix into
aromatic residues presented by the α-helix, similar to knobs-
into-holes interactions found in coiled coils, Figure 3. The
helices were borrowed from the bacterial adhesin AgI/II49 and
an intervening loop from a pancreatic polypeptide.50 We

extent His); electron-rich aromatics, Trp and Tyr, with Trp
showing a preference for miniproteins twice that of
larger
proteins; and Pro. In contrast, small amino acids and the
aliphatic hydrophobics are found more often in the larger
proteins. This suggests that the polar aromatics and longer
charged amino acids provide routes to good noncovalent
interactions, that is, salt bridges and CH−π and cation−π
interactions, and that Pro helps reduce the entropic cost of
folding as well as buttressing aromatics in the core.

selected ∼6 turns of α helix to partner ∼3 turns of polyproline
helix to maintain knobs-into-holes-like interactions along the
lengths of both helices. The tyrosine variant, PPα-Tyr, is water-
soluble and monomeric and unfolds cooperatively with a TM of
39 °C.
An NMR structure reveals intimate CH−π interactions51
between the proline and aromatic side chains, Figure 3D. We
have explored the importance of these interactions by mutating
the three parent tyrosine residues to para-substituted phenyl-
alanine residues with varying ring electron densities. These
experiments highlight electronic and electrostatic contributions
to the interaction beyond van der Waals’ contacts, as the more
electron-rich aromatics lead to more stable PPα variants.
Interestingly, of the proteinogenic aromatic side chains, Pro−
Tyr and Pro−Trp interactions gave PPα variants with similar
thermal
stabilities. This corroborates our bioinformatics
analyses of the PDB, which highlights a preference for CH−π
interactions between Pro and the electron-rich aromatics but
not Phe.19
■ COMMON FEATURES: BIOINFORMATICS
ANALYSIS OF MINIPROTEINS IN THE PDB

We have also examined secondary structure content using
the Deﬁne Secondary Structure of Proteins (DSSP) algorithm,
Figure 4.52 This revealed similar proportions of α helix in
miniproteins and larger proteins; but less β strand in the former
(with the exception of the water-soluble β-hairpins and three-
stranded β-sheets, of course). It is possible that this is due to
bias in the data set rather than miniprotein requirements. Also,
it appears that miniproteins have more-contorted backbones
and make better use of structured loops to best sequester
hydrophobics within their interiors. Concomitant with reduced
regular secondary structures, we found fewer main chain−main
chain hydrogen bonds in miniproteins, with half of the residues
making these compared with approximately three-quarters in
larger proteins. The shortfall in miniproteins is likely made up
by more hydrogen bonds to water, as their small size gives
greater surface area-to-volume ratios.

large aromatics, particularly Trp,

The above examples hint at common features that relate
miniprotein sequence, structure, and stability. For example, the
importance of
in the
hydrophobic cores of miniproteins. To explore this and to
seek other sequence-to-structure relationships, we performed a
comparative bioinformatics analysis of the mini- and large
proteins in the PDB. For this, we culled a nonredundant
database of X-ray crystal and solution NMR structures of
miniproteins of ≤40 residues and with <40% pairwise sequence
identity, Figure 4 and a set of larger proteins with >100 residues
and high-resolution (≤1.0 Å) X-ray crystal structures. We
veriﬁed our set of miniproteins contained only monomeric
structures determined in aqueous media.

First, we compared the amino-acid compositions of the two
sets, Figure 5. Miniproteins use three classes of amino acids
more often than the larger proteins: long or charged amino
acids, for example, Arg, Glu, Lys, and Met (and to a lesser

So how are miniproteins stabilized? True,

the overall
entropic cost of folding a miniprotein might be lower than
that for larger proteins, but it will still be unfavorable and will
have to be recouped by enthalpically favorable interactions.
However, it is clear that fewer such interactions are made in
miniproteins as they generally have broader thermal unfolding
transitions than larger proteins.19 Nonetheless, there must be
favorable noncovalent interactions to outweigh the TΔS term
of folding. To address this, we are actively interrogating the
above databases for sequence-to-structure/stability relation-
ships. It is early in this analysis, but trends are emerging. For
example, we ﬁnd that, when normalized for length, mini-
proteins make up to eight times as many salt bridges as their
longer counterparts; and when normalized for both length and

■ OUTLOOK

We have attempted to cover four decades of miniprotein
research in a 6000-word Account. As a result, we have had to
omit many of the fascinating aspects of these studies, including
details of
the experimental and
theoretical methods used, the sequences explored, and the
nuances of the results obtained. However, we hope to have
conveyed two main aspects of miniprotein research and

the approaches

taken,

development
that others may ﬁnd useful, namely: ﬁrst, a
chronology and overview of miniprotein discovery and, with it,
the design and engineering approaches taken to reveal them;
and, second, common sequence and structural features found in
miniproteins
through these studies and our own, albeit
preliminary, bioinformatics analysis of the RCSB PDB.

On the latter, sequence-to-structure/stability relationships
are clearly emerging for miniprotein folding. Moreover, these
are being discussed and, indeed, understood in terms of the
noncovalent interactions that underpin them. For miniproteins,
and mostly in contrast to what is possible with larger proteins,

these interactions can be probed with atomic resolution using
synthetic peptide chemistry: nonproteinogenic amino acids can
be introduced into miniproteins, and principles and methods
from physical organic chemistry can be used to rationalize their
impact on structure and stability.5,19 Such knowledge and
understanding will not only illuminate how miniproteins are
stabilized but also how protein structures are speciﬁed and
maintained in general.5,19,53,54 In turn, this will undoubtedly
improve our abilities to engineer existing miniproteins and to
design new examples of these de novo. We anticipate that, along
with the in biro (back-of-the-envelope) and rational design
approaches
that have been favored to date, parametric
computational protein design will become increasingly used
to deliver new miniproteins. Here, a challenge for the protein-
design community will be to make their methods more
available to nonexpert users.

important aspect of

One thing that we have neglected in this Account is the
potential
to functionalize miniproteins for both basic and
applied research; we have had to focus on structures and
sequence-to-structure/stability relationships rather
than on
structure−function relationships. Many have contributed to
the ﬁeld.5,13−15 For example,
this
miniproteins provide scaﬀolds onto which functional motifs
can be grafted.14,55 The most clear-cut application here is the
introduction of binding and recognition motifs, for example, to
interfere with protein−protein interactions. In addition, and
although more challenging, there are prospects for introducing
catalytic functions
into simpliﬁed peptide and protein
architectures.14,21 With the array of structures that we have
presented and others that are coming online, and with the
underpinning thermodynamic understanding of
these, we
anticipate further and considerable advances on this road to
functional miniproteins.

Finally, and particularly exciting to us, is the concept that
miniproteins might be used as building blocks to design and
engineer entirely new protein folds. This might be termed
proteins from peptides (we thank Andrei Lupas for this phrase)
or protein design by pieces.56−58 It oﬀers routes into what is being
called the dark matter of protein fold space,59 and, thus, into a
truly synthetic biology.60
