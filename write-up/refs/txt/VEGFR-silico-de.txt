The family of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) ligands and their interactions with VEGF 
receptors (VEGFRs) play important roles in both pathological and physiological angiogenesis. Hence, 
agonistic and antagonistic ligands targeting this signaling pathway have potential for both studies on 
fundamental biology and for development of therapies and diagnostics. Here, we engineer VEGFR2‑
binding affibody molecules for increased thermostability, refolding and improved biodistribution. 
We designed libraries based on the original monomeric binders with the intention of reducing 
hydrophobicity, while retaining high affinity for VEGFR2. Libraries were displayed on bacteria and 
binders were isolated by fluorescence‑activated cell sorting (FACS). In parallel, we used an automated 
sequence‑ and structure‑based in silico algorithm to identify potentially stabilizing mutations. 
Monomeric variants isolated from the screening and the in silico approach, respectively, were 
characterized by circular dichroism spectroscopy and biosensor assays. The most promising mutations 
were combined into new monomeric constructs which were finally fused into a dimeric construct, 
resulting in a 15 °C increase in melting temperature, complete refolding capability after heat‑induced 
denaturation, retained low picomolar affinity and improved biodistribution profile in an in vivo mouse 
model. These VEGFR2‑binding affibody molecules show promise as candidates for further in vivo 
studies to assess their suitability as molecular imaging and therapeutic agents.

Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that is 
important in both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Its activation promotes vascular permeability, as 
well as cell migration and  proliferation1,2. The different VEGF family ligands bind to VEGFRs and act as agonists 
by inducing dimerization of the receptors which in turn leads to subsequent phosphorylation of the intracellular 
kinase domains and signaling. The role of angiogenesis in diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, 
diabetic retinopathy, and tumor progression, has made it a prevalent target for therapeutic  strategies3. Various 
therapeutics have been developed for anti-angiogenic treatment by targeting VEGFR2 signaling. Bevacizumab, 
an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds and neutralizes human VEGF isoforms is approved for 
glioblastoma, colorectal cancer and several other cancer  types4,5. Aflibercept, a recombinant Fc-linked decoy 
receptor that is based on fusion of subdomains from VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, binds VEGF isoforms as well as the 
placenta growth factor (PIGF)6,7 and has been approved for treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in combina-
tion with chemotherapy, and for wet macular degeneration. Ramucirumab, a mAb that blocks the ligand-binding

several other cancer  forms8. Here we report on the engineering and evaluation of an affibody-based VEGFR2 
binder that has a similar mechanism of action as ramucirumab.

Affibody molecules are small (58 residues) three-helical affinity proteins, originally derived from one of the 
immunoglobulin-binding domains of staphylococcal protein  A9,10, which are engineered by directed evolution 
for specific and high affinity to various protein target molecules. These small protein domains are cysteine free, 
which enables introduction of unique cysteines for thiol mediated site-specific coupling of assorted compounds, 
and their small size and typically fast and independent reversible folding facilitates engineering of multimeric 
 proteins11,12. An Il-17 binding affibody molecule is currently in clinical phase 2 trials (AFFIRM-35) for treating 
plaque psoriasis (https ://clini caltr ials.gov).

In a previous study, we have engineered a high-affinity biparatopic (i.e. a heterodimer of two individual bind-
ing entities) affibody molecule that acts as an antagonist to VEGFR2 signaling by blocking VEGFA-binding13. 
Regarding bioactivity, the protein binds to a region on the receptor that is overlapping with the epitope of VEGF-
A and was shown to efficiently block VEGF-mediated VEGFR2 phosphorylation, cell proliferation and sprout 
formation in vitro14. The dimer is cross-reactive to both human and murine  VEGFR214 and was employed as an 
in vivo imaging agent for visualization of vascularization in a murine glioblastoma  model15. Although the previ-
ously reported dimer demonstrated promising results both in terms of vascular targeting and agonistic effects, 
we had identified issues with relatively low thermostability, aggregation and elevated uptake in healthy tissue, 
most notably liver and spleen, observed in a preclinical biodistribution  study15.

In addition to high and specific biological activity, the use of proteins in clinical settings requires long shelf-
life, high-concentration formulation and retained activity at physiological temperatures. Several of these attrib-
utes are directly linked to the thermal stability of the protein but are generally not directly a focus of the initial 
directed-evolution based drug discovery process of biologics. Furthermore, experience in engineering of proteins 
has shown that minor alterations in protein sequence can result in dramatic biophysical  improvements16. How-
ever, such properties are generally more difficult to engineer by directed evolution compared with for example 
affinity and catalytic activity. Numerous more rational protein-engineering strategies have been explored to 
increase the thermal stability. Examples include approaches based on homology sequence  algorithms17, high-
resolution 3D  structures18, introduction of disulfide  bridges19,  circularization20, shortening of solvent-exposed 
 loops21, destabilization of parental protein before  engineering22, hydrophobic core  packing23 and mutation of 
surface-exposed hydrophobic side  chains24.

Our objective with this study was to improve the thermal stability and refolding capability of the previously 
developed VEGFR2-binding affibody  heterodimer13. We explored two different approaches for the engineering: 
in silico stabilization through a web-based algorithm called Protein Repair One-Stop  Shop25 (PROSS) and com-
binatorial directed evolution by an in-house display method based on the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus 
carnosus26. In staphylococcal display, the recombinant proteins are C-terminally anchored to the peptidoglycan 
cell wall by endogenous sortase A. The multivalent display (10,000–100,000 copies per cell) enables quantitative 
assessment of the relative affinity to fluorescently labelled target molecules by high-throughput screening using 
flow cytometry. In both strategies, the two individual affibody molecules that constitute the dimer were separately 
engineered as monomers. In parallel, they were subjected to directed evolution and PROSS. The library for the 
directed evolution approach was designed to exclude new surface-exposed hydrophobic amino acids, which could 
potentially reduce the hydrophobic surface-area of selected candidates. Output monomers from the two separate 
tracks were characterized by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), to 
identify stabilizing mutations with retained binding. Stabilized monomers were reformatted into dimers and the 
biodistribution of the most promising dimeric variant was thereafter evaluated in a murine model.

Results
Library design and flow‑cytometric screening of libraries.  A total of six libraries were designed for 
the two original affibody molecules, in which 13 surface-exposed positions were randomized. The mutation fre-
quency was set to 1, 2 and 3 mutations per affibody, respectively, and all hydrophobic residues as well as cysteine 
and proline were excluded from the randomized positions (Fig. 1). The six libraries are hereinafter denoted 
16lib1, 16lib2, 16lib3, 40lib1, 40lib2 and 40lib3. The resulting six individual libraries were separately subcloned 
into the staphylococcal display vector in fusion to an albumin-binding domain (ABD), which is used for normal-
ization of surface expression level by co-incubation with fluorescently labelled albumin. The subcloned libraries 
were then transformed into Staphylococcus carnosus with diversities covering the library sizes at least ten-fold 
for each library. DNA sequencing of a subset of clones from respective library confirmed distribution of amino 
acid mutations and frequencies according to designs (data not shown). Staphylococcal cells displaying affibody 
molecules with affinity for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) were isolated via fluores-
cence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Sorting gates were set to isolate the top 0.5% of the population with highest 
target binding to surface expression ratio. Different target concentrations and an off-rate selection was used in 
the sorting rounds. Only one round of FACS was performed, using a concentration of 100 nM labeled human 
VEGFR2-His, for the libraries with one mutation per affibody. For the libraries with two and three mutations 
per affibody, two additional rounds were performed, first with 10 nM labeled human VEGFR2-His and secondly 
an off-rate selection where the bacterial library was incubated with 100 nM labeled VEGFR2-His, followed by 
washing and incubation with an excess of unlabeled target for 6 h before sorting (Figure S1). Following the final 
round of selection, sequencing of variants isolated from the screening revealed unique variants from which the 
top 5% most frequent sequences for each library were further characterized. The average number of mutations 
per variant for isolated clones corresponded well to the library design (data not shown).

Flow cytometric on‑cell ranking of VEGFR2 binding.  Following FACS, isolated variants with a higher 
frequency than 5% in the sequenced population were compared by flow-cytometric analysis. Ranking of indi-
vidual bacteria-displayed binders was done by incubation with labeled VEGFR2-His at 20 nM. A total of 23 
clones were analyzed by flow cytometry and ranked by comparing the ratio of VEGFR2 binding signal and sur-
face expression levels. All 23 analyzed clones showed higher normalized signal compared to their non-matured 
original counterpart (data not shown). The top six candidates from 16lib1-3 and top six from 40lib1-3 with 
highest signals were chosen for further analysis as soluble proteins (Table 1).

exhibited alpha-helical content. The melting temperatures of clones isolated from 16lib1-3 varied between 43 
and 48 °C and for clones isolated from 40lib1-3 varied between 42 and 49 °C (Fig. 2a). The majority of isolated 
clones demonstrated both higher melting temperature and more complete refolding than the original binders. 
Interestingly, a non-intended mutation (F30L) in clone 40matH that is in the hydrophobic core of the protein did 
not have a negative influence on the thermal stability. The binding of soluble proteins to VEGFR2 was analyzed 
using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (Fig. 2b). Data was fitted using non-linear regression to a monovalent 
binding equation. The binding affinities were determined to be in the range of 10 nM–50 nM for variants isolated 
from 16lib1-3 and 3 nM–20 nM for variants isolated from 40lib1-3. Interestingly the variant 40matH with the 
non-intended mutation exhibited the highest affinity. Based on the thermal stability, refolding capability and 
binding to VEGFR2 two clones were chosen from 16lib1-3 and three from 40lib1-3 for construction of dimers 
and further analysis.

the protein, which is unavailable for the affibody molecules in this study. Therefore SWISS-MODEL was used 
to generate a predicted structure based on homology-modeling on a crystal structure of an affibody molecule

(3MZW) that binds human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Moreover, PROSS allows locking spe-
cific residues in the target protein, i.e. amino acids that are important for binding can be protected from muta-
tions introduced by PROSS. Hence, we locked the 13 residues on the affibody binding interface (in helix 1 and 2) 
that are usually randomized to generate libraries (Fig. 1). The PROSS generated a total of six variants; three per 
submitted binder, respectively  (ZVEGFR2_16 and  ZVEGFR2_40) (Table 2).

Thermal  stability  and  VEGFR2‑binding  of  affibody  monomers  from  PROSS.  Genes  for  the 
PROSS-tool generated variants  (ZVEGFR2_16-PROSS2,  ZVEGFR2_16-PROSS3,  ZVEGFR2_40-PROSS5,  ZVEGFR2_40-PROSS6) (Table 2) 
were ordered as monomers with a N-terminal His6-tag, cloned into an expression vector and produced in E. 
coli. After purification, we started with analysis of the variants containing multiple mutations  (ZVEGFR2_16-PROSS2, 
 ZVEGFR2_16-PROSS3,  ZVEGFR2_40-PROSS5 and  ZVEGFR2_40-PROSS6). Thermal stability was analyzed by CD spectroscopy and 
showed that  ZVEGFR2_40-PROSS5 and  ZVEGFR2_40-PROSS6 exhibited higher melting temperatures, 6 °C and 9 °C respec-
tively, compared to the original construct (Fig. 3a). On the other hand,  ZVEGFR2_16-PROSS2 and  ZVEGFR2_16-PROSS3 had 
melting temperatures that were too low to be determined (Fig. 3a). This was likely due to the L34N mutation that 
points into the hydrophobic core of the affibody molecule and probably disrupts the tight packing of the core by 
introduction of a polar amino acid. The stabilizing mutations from  ZVEGFR2_40-PROSS6 were therefore grafted onto 
 ZVEGFR2_16, denoted  ZVEGFR2_16-PROSS6 (Table 2), which resulted in an increase in the melting temperature of 10 °C. 
Surface plasmon resonance was used to determine the kinetic constants of the mutants and ensure retained 
ability to bind the receptor (Fig. 3b). In order to determine which mutations from the PROSS6 design that 
were contributing to increased stability, single mutant variants (i.e. S42A, E43N, S46A and S54A of respective 
binder) were ordered, produced and characterized by CD as mentioned above. Results showed that all muta-
tions contributed to incremental stabilization in terms of melting temperatures and suggested that the stabilizing 
mutations are additive (Fig. 3c). A schematic representation of final residue mutations generated by PROSS and 
amino acids locked from mutation is shown in Fig. 3d.

Production and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis of new dimeric mutants.  The 
most  promising  candidates  from  FACS   (ZVEGFR2_16matD,   ZVEGFR2_16matG,   ZVEGFR2_40matB  and   ZVEGFR2_40matC)  were 
combined with the most promising mutations from the in silico engineering (i.e. the PROSS6 design). Mono-
mers were then genetically linked with a S4G linker and a C-terminal engineered albumin-binding domain 
(ABD) was introduced for affinity purification and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) capture assays. We also 
included  ZVEGFR2_16-40 (parental dimer) and  ZVEGFR2_16-40-PROSS6 (parental dimer with PROSS6 mutations in both 
domains) for comparison. Thus, a total of five constructs were produced (Table 3) as described above and puri-
fied by affinity chromatography using the high affinity interaction between ABD and human serum albumin 
(HSA). Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was then used to analyze purified dimeric proteins and visualize 
potential aggregation or degradation (Figure S2). All dimers showed one distinct peak which corresponds to 
intact dimeric protein. SEC chromatograms for both the original binder  ZVEGFR2_16-40 and   ZVEGFR2_16-40-PROSS6 
indicated degradation (Figure S2). This tendency of degradation could not be detected in the three new dimeric 
proteins  (ZVEGFR2_16matD-40matC-PROSS6,  ZVEGFR2_16matG-40matB-PROSS6 and  ZVEGFR2_16matG-40matC-PROSS6).

Affinity  determination  of  new  dimeric  mutants  to  VEGFR2.  The  three  different  dimers 
 (ZVEGFR2_16matD-40matC-PROSS6,  ZVEGFR2_16matG-40matB-PROSS6 and  ZVEGFR2_16matG-40matC-PROSS6) were then subjected to bio-
sensor analysis by surface plasmon resonance on a Biacore 8 K to determine their equilibrium dissociation 
constants  (KD). Binders were injected over immobilized HSA and captured for subsequent injection of VEGFR2 
at varying concentrations. Data was fitted using non-linear regression to a monovalent binding model. Experi-
ments were performed at three temperatures (25, 37 and 40 °C) and obtained affinities were similar between 
the original dimer and the final stability engineered dimer (Figure S3), demonstrating that the stabilized dimers 
retained their binding to VEGFR2. All experiments were run in duplicates with freshly prepared reagents.

Thermal  stability  of  new  dimeric  mutants.  The  three  different  dimers   (ZVEGFR2_16matD-40matC-PROSS6, 
 ZVEGFR2_16matG-40matB-PROSS6 and  ZVEGFR2_16matG-40matC-PROSS6) were then further characterized by CD spectroscopy 
to evaluate their thermostabilities and refolding capabilities. All proteins were subjected to CD analysis at a con-
centration of 0.3 mg/ml. Thermal stability was determined by measuring ellipticity at 221 nm over a temperature 
range of 22–90 °C. Lowest stability was seen for the original binder  ZVEGFR2_16-40. Incorporation of PROSS muta-

tions led to an increase in melting temperature by 7 °C, and the final combination of PROSS mutations with 
in vitro generated mutations  (ZVEGFR2_16matG-40matB-PROSS6) led to another 8 °C improvement, adding up to a total 
of 15 °C improvement in melting temperature (Fig. 4a).

Before and after variable temperature measurement, ellipticity was analyzed at 195–260 nm at 22° for assess-
ment of protein refolding. The original binder  ZVEGFR2_16-40 and  ZVEGFR2_16-40-PROSS6 both showed incomplete 
refolding after variable temperature measurements. Contrarily, the engineered dimer demonstrated complete 
refolding (Fig. 4b, c, d). The most promising heterodimeric affibody  (ZVEGFR2_16matG-40matB-PROSS6) is hereinafter 
denoted  ZVEGFR2_3gen.

Production and characterization of protein for radiolabeling.  ZVEGFR2_3gen was subcloned with an 
N-terminal HEHEHE-tag for immobilized metal ion chromatography (IMAC) purification and labelling with 
+, and produced in E. coli as described above. Moreover, a second construct was subcloned and 
 [99mTc]Tc(CO)3
produced  in E.  coli  with  an  N-terminal  HEHEHE-tag  and  also  a  C-terminal  ABD.  Produced  proteins  were 
characterized by gel electrophoresis, analytical high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), electrospray 
ionization mass spectrometry (ESI–MS) and SPR, which confirmed protein purity, size and VEGFR2-binding, 
respectively (data not shown).

Radiolabeling and radiolabel stability.  After purification, both proteins were successfully labelled with 
 [99mTc]Tc(CO)3

fused dimer as determined by instant thin layer chromatography (ITLC) analysis of reaction mixtures. Isolated

yield was 76 ± 1% and 89.5 ± 0.5%, respectively. Radiochemical purity of labeled conjugates used in the experi-
ments was 100%. Label stability was analysed after 4 h incubation in PBS and both conjugates demonstrated high 
stability (over 99% of activity was associated with protein).

Analysis of in vitro specificity and cellular processing.  Analysis of binding of both labeled conju-
gates to murine VEGFR2-expressing cells (MS-1) showed that cell-associated activity was significantly lower 
for cells pre-incubated with non-labelled conjugate, indicating specific binding (Fig. 5a). Cellular processing 
of labelled conjugates over time was studied using MS-1 cells under continuous incubation. Both conjugates 
demonstrated similar patterns of binding and internalization (Fig. 5b,c). Cell-associated activity increased over 
time, the internalization of labelled conjugates was moderate and internalised fraction reached 50% for  [99mTc]
Tc(CO)3-HEHEHE-  ZVEGFR2_3gen and 40% for  [99mTc]Tc(CO)3-HEHEHE-  ZVEGFR2_3gen-ABD at the end of the 
observation period.

In vivo biodistribution studies.  Biodistribution of  [99mTc]Tc(CO)3-HEHEHE-ZVEGFR2_3gen and  [99mTc]
Tc(CO)3-HEHEHE-   ZVEGFR2_3gen-ABD  was  investigated  in  NMRI  mice  using  two  different  protein  doses, 
respectively (Fig. 6a,b). Both conjugates demonstrated dose-dependent distribution patterns. For organs with 
endogenous receptor expression (e.g. lung, liver and spleen), injection of higher protein dose (i.e. more unla-
belled affibody constructs) lead to a significant decrease in activity uptake (for ABD-fused conjugate not signifi-
cant, but strong tendency for liver), indicating blockable receptor-mediated uptake. Activity uptake in salivary 
gland (i.e. organs that typically accumulate radiocatabolites in case of label instability) was low for both injected

body significantly increased.

Biodistribution  patterns  of   [99mTc]Tc(CO)3-HEHEHE-ZVEGFR2_3gen  and   [99mTc]Tc(CO)3-HEHEHE- 
 ZVEGFR2_3gen-ABD were compared 2 and 24 h pi in normal mice (Fig. 6). Dimer without ABD demonstrated rapid 
blood clearance that was similar to the previously studied biparatopic  dimer15. Comparison of the biodistribution 
patterns of the new conjugates 2 h pi clearly demonstrated that ABD-fused dimer had significantly longer blood 
circulation and lower excretion rate than non-fused dimer.

The ABD-fused conjugate demonstrated 20-fold higher activity concentration in blood in comparison with 
non-fused dimer at 2 h pi. In agreement with this result, activity uptake in all tested organs and tissues was 
higher for  [99mTc]Tc(CO)3-HEHEHE-ZVEGFR2_3gen-ABD, except for kidneys where activity uptake was significantly 
lower for ABD-fused dimer. The overall pattern of activity uptake was similar at both time points for both tested 
conjugates. With time, initial activity uptake decreased in all studied tissues (values were significantly lower 
for all tested organs and tissues except salivary glands for non-fused conjugate and spleen for ABD-fused one).
Comparison of blood retention of ABD-fused dimer with other ABD-fused affibody molecules showed 
that blood clearance of VEGFR2-targeting affibody conjugate was more rapid than HER2-targeting  [111In]
In-ZHER2:2891-ABD035-DOTA27, but comparable with some HER3-targeting conjugates, particularly  [111In]In-
(ZHER3:08698)2-ABD035-DOTA and  [111In]In-ABD035-(ZHER3:08698)2-DOTA28.

Discussion
Here, we report on the engineering and evaluation of a recently generated so-called “biparatopic” affibody 
molecule that binds two adjacent and non-overlapping sites within the VEGF-binding epitope on human and 
murine VEGFR2 with picomolar affinity. The dimeric affibody binds to the VEGF epitope on the receptor

endothelial  cells14. In a previous study,  [111In]In-labeled affibody dimer was able to specifically target VEGFR2 
in vivo with much higher tumor-to-blood ratios compared to other VEGFR2 imaging  probes15. However, the 
 [111In]In-labeled constructs use is challenging due to relatively high uptake in some metastatic sites such as liver 
and spleen. Furthermore, the affibody construct demonstrated issues related to relatively low thermostability, 
aggregation tendencies, incomplete refolding and high uptake in liver and  spleen15. The latter has been shown 
to correlate with the overall hydrophobicity of affibody-based  tracers29. Thus, the overall aim of this study was 
therefore to engineer new dimeric variants with increased thermal stability and solubility, while retaining high-
affinity binding to VEGFR2.

We here used two protein engineering  strategies. In each track, affibody monomers constituting the dimer 
were engineered separately. A web-based in silico modelling algorithm called PROSS was used to target frame-
work residues (i.e. amino acids not involved in receptor binding), and directed evolution by an in-house staphy-
lococcal display method and FACS was used to target residues in the binding interface. The libraries for directed 
evolution were designed with the aim to increase hydrophilicity while retaining binding.

Mutations proposed by the PROSS algorithm resulted in stabilizing mutations for  ZVEGFR2_40. On the other 
hand, initial PROSS mutations suggested for  ZVEGFR2_16 introduced a polar side chain (L34N) into the hydro-
phobic core of the protein, which turned out to be detrimental for the stability of the protein. Mutations for 
 ZVEGFR2_40, which demonstrated the highest thermal stabilization, were therefore grafted onto  ZVEGFR2_16, which 
resulted in similar stabilization. Interestingly, single-mutant analysis demonstrated that suggested mutations 
were predominantly additive, a feature mentioned in the development of  PROSS25.

A number of new variants were isolated by FACS from the six libraries, and CD spectroscopy and SPR revealed 
that the vast majority had improved thermal stability and retained high-affinity binding to VEGFR2. The muta-
tions from PROSS and FACS were thus combined into new versions of the monomers, which were then fused 
again to construct new dimeric binders. The final dimeric protein  (ZVEGFR2_3gen) had a 15 °C improvement in 
melting temperature and demonstrated complete refolding after heat treatment, in contrast to the original binder.
The biodistribution of  ZVEGFR2_3gen was finally evaluated in NMRI mice. The most striking difference when 
comparing with previous biodistribution studies of the original binder, was the rather dramatic decrease in activ-
ity uptake in spleen and  liver15, which is likely due to the increased thermostability and complete refolding for 
the new engineered binder. The new conjugate [99mTc]Tc(CO)3-HEHEHE-ZVEGFR2_3gen showed approximately 
13-fold lower uptake in liver and spleen compared to the previous version of the dimeric VEGFR2-specific 
 affibody15. It has been shown in previous biodistribution studies with affibodies that the hydrophobicity of the 
tracer has a significant impact on uptake in liver and  spleen29. However, it should be noted that different radio 
labelling strategies were used in these two studies, which might influence the biodistribution. From the biodis-
tribution results, it was also evident that fusion of the engineered ABD lead to a dramatic increase in serum 
half-life of the affibody construct, indicating that this would be a feasible strategy to prolong the blood circulation 
time in future therapeutic studies. Comparison of blood retention of ABD-fused dimer with other ABD-fused 
affibody molecules showed that blood clearance of VEGFR2-targeting affibody conjugate was more rapid than 
HER2-targeting  [111In]In-ZHER2:2891-ABD035-DOTA27, but comparable with some HER3-targeting conjugates, 
particularly  [111In]In-(ZHER3:08698)2-ABD035-DOTA and  [111In]In-ABD035-(ZHER3:08698)2-DOTA28.

To conclude, we have used directed evolution and an algorithm-based approach to generate VEGFR2 binding 
affibody molecules with increased stability. The stabilizing mutations that were identified from the two different 
procedures were ultimately grafted into one construct and fused in a dimeric format to generate variants with 
significantly enhanced stability. Retained binding of the affibody molecules to VEGFR2 was verified by SPR. A 
biodistribution study also indicated decreased uptake in healthy tissues and these results together with previously 
published data on strong agonistic activity show that the VEGFR2-specific affibody molecules are promising for 
further in vivo studies and evaluations.

Materials and methods
Design  and  molecular  cloning  of  combinatorial  libraries.  A  total  of  six  different  libraries  were 
designed and ordered from Twist bioscience (Fig. 1a). The genes were amplified by eight cycles of PCR using 
Phusion DNA polymerase, purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and 
digested with restriction enzymes XhoI and SacI. Digested oligonucleotides and plasmid (pSCZ1) were purified 
by preparative gel electrophoresis (2% GTG agarose) and Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen GmbH). Libraries 
were ligated into the display vector using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA), according 
manufacturer’s instructions. Ligated plasmids were purified and concentrated using ethanol precipitation before 
being transformed into electrocompetent One Shot TOP10 cells, which were used as a host for plasmid produc-
tion.

Preparation was performed with a JETSTAR Maxi Kit (Genomed, Bad Oeynhausen, Germany) according to 
manufacturer’s instructions and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. Plasmids were sequenced (Microsynth 
AG, Balgach, Switzerland) before transformation into Staphylococcus carnosus TM300 by electroporation as 
previously  described30. Individual colonies were then once again sequenced (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland) 
prior to selection screening.

FACS of bacteria‑displayed affibody libraries.  All six libraries were individually inoculated to 5 ml 
tryptic soy broth supplemented with yeast extract (TSB + YE; Merck) with 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol (Sigma-
Aldrich) and incubated at 150 rpm 37 °C ON. The next day, cells were harvested by centrifugation (3000 g, 
5 min, RT) and labelled for flow cytometry as previously  described31 using biotin-XX Microscale Protein Labe-
ling Kit biotinylated (ThermoFisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) VEGFR2-His (Sino Biological Inc., Beijing,

and human serum albumin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 (HSA-Alexa Fluor 647) for 45 min in a second incu-
bation. Before screening, cells were washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 
0.1% Pluronic F108 NF Surfactant (PBSP; pH 7.4; BASF Corporation, Mount Olive, NJ) and resuspended in 
1.5 ml ice-cold PBSP. One round of selection, with target VEGFR2 concentration of 100 nM, was performed for 
the smallest libraries containing only one mutant per variant and three rounds were performed for the libraries 
containing 2 and 3 mutations per variant (Figure S1), using a MoFlo Astrios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, 
Indianapolis, IN, USA). Around 0.5% of the population was sorted in each round based on highest surface 
expression-normalized VEGFR2-binding signal, into TSB + YE and grown overnight with 10 μg/ml chloram-
phenicol. In the second round of selection, a target concentration of 10 nM was used. In the third round, an 
off-rate selection strategy was applied where cells were first incubated with 100 nM VEGFR2-His and after wash-
ing, an excess of unlabeled VEGFR2 was added and left for 6 h incubation, before secondary labeling. Finally, 
cells isolated from selections were plated on chloramphenicol containing plates and individual colonies were 
sequenced (Microsynth).

Analysis of VEGFR2 binding of isolated clones by flow cytometry. 
Individual clones isolated from 
the selection were inoculated in 5 ml TSB + YE with 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol and grown ON at 150 rpm 
and 37 °C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 g and re-suspended in PBSP containing biotinylated 
VEGFR2. After 1 h, cells were washed with ice-cold PBSP and re-suspended in ice-cold PBSP containing SAPE 
and HSA-Alexa Fluor 647. Finally, cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBSP and analyzed by flow-cytometry 
using a Gallios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Cells were then ranked based on ratio between VEGFR2-
binding and cell surface expression (Figure S1). All experiments were performed in duplicates on different days 
using freshly prepared reagents.

Subcloning and production of affibody molecule variants from selection.  A total of twelve mon-
omeric variants isolated from the screening were subcloned from the pSCZ1 display vector into pET-26b( +). 
Soluble protein production in Escherichia coli BL21 Star (DE3) cells (Invitrogen) and purification by immobi-
lized metal ion chromatography (IMAC) was performed as previously  described13.

Circular dichroism spectroscopy.  All circular dichroism spectroscopy experiments were performed by 
subjecting affibody molecules to 195–260 nm and 22 °C using a Chirascan spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, 
California, USA) in a cell with an optical path-length of 1 mm at a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. Thermal stability 
was analyzed by measuring ellipticity at 221 nm over a temperature range of 22–90 °C (5 °C/min).

Surface plasmon resonance characterization of monomers isolated from selection.  Surface 
plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed using a Biacore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare, Upp-
sala,  Sweden)  using  phosphate-buffered  saline  supplemented  with  0.05%  Tween  20  (PBST  0.05)  as  running 
buffer and 10 mM HCl for regeneration. Signal from blank surface interactions were subtracted for each run. 
Recombinant human VEGFR2-His (Sino Biological) was immobilized by amine coupling on two surfaces of a 
CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare). Binding of variants isolated from library screening was analyzed by injections 
of five different concentrations of the Affibody molecules (100, 50, 25, 12.5 and 6.25 nM) over the immobilized 
VEGFR2-His. The experiment was performed in duplicates using freshly prepared reagents.

Protein Repair One‑stop Shop (PROSS).  Following the instructions on the web server (https ://pross 
.weizm ann.ac.il), two homology modeled protein structures based on  ZVEGFR2_16 and  ZVEGFR2_40 were generated 
from PDB:id 3MZW and submitted to the PROSS. 13 amino acids that are part of the binding interface on 
the affibody molecule in helix 1 and 2 were locked whilst remaining residues were subject to introduction of 
mutations by PROSS. The sequence alignment required for the PROSS to function was generated through the 
website’s default process.

Molecular cloning, protein production and purification of PROSS‑generated variants.  Genes 
for the variants generated by PROSS were synthesized and sub-cloned into the expression vector pET26b( +) by 
using XhoI and NdeI restriction sites (GeneArt, ThermoFischer Scientific, Courtaboeuf, France). A His6-tag 
was included N-terminally to facilitate purification by immobilized metal ion chromatography (IMAC). Puri-
fied proteins were characterized as described above, by CD to determine thermostability and SPR to determine 
affinity towards VEGFR2.

Subcloning, expression and purification of dimeric binders.  Monomeric variants isolated from the 
library with the highest stability and retained binding were grafted together with the stabilizing mutations gen-
erated by PROSS, and an engineered albumin-binding domain (ABD) was added to facilitate purification and 
surface plasmon resonance capture-based analysis. The genes for five different dimeric constructs (Table 3) were 
ordered from ThermoFischer Scientific and subcloned into the expression vector pET26b ( +), transformed to E. 
coli BL21 Star (DE3) cells (Invitrogen), and produced and purified as described above.

Radiolabelling and stability.  All buffers used for labelling and purification were prepared from chemicals 
from Sigma-Aldrich. Site-specific radiolabelling of HEHEHE-ZVEGFR2_3gen and HEHEHE-ZVEGFR2_3gen-
ABD with  [99mTc]Tc(CO)3(H2O)3]+ was performed as described  earlier32. Briefly, the generator eluate (500 μl)

− was added in a sealed vial containing a CRS kit (Center for Radiophar-
maceutical Sciences, PSI, Villigen, Switzerland) and incubated at 100 °C for 30 min. After incubation, 40 μl of 
technetium tricarbonyl solution was added to conjugate solutions in PBS (6.8 nmol, 1 mg/ml)). The reaction 
was incubated for 60 min at 50 °C. The labelling yield was determined by instant thin layer chromatography 
(ITLC; 150–771 DARK GREEN, Tec-Control Chromatography strips, Biodex Medical Systems) eluted with PBS. 
Radio-ITLC were measured on a Cyclone Storage Phosphor System on radioactivity distribution and analysed 
with the OptiQuant image analysis software (both from Perkin Elmer Sweden AB). The radiolabelled conjugates 
were purified using NAP-5 columns (Amersham Biosciences) eluted with PBS. The in vitro stability test was 
performed by incubating the radiolabelled conjugates in PBS for 4 h at room temperature. The stability was 
assessed as described above.

In vitro characterization.  The pancreatic islet endothelial cells MS1 (Mus EC MS1 mouse endothelial) 
used was a kind gift from Dr. Jack L. Arbiser, Children’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston,  MA33.

MS1 cells were cultured in DMEM growth media (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium) with a low L-glu-
tamine level, supplemented with 10% FBS (Fetal bovine serum, Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% PEST (Penicillin 100 UI/
mL, streptomycin 100 µg/mL, all from Biochrom AG) in a 37 °C incubator with 5%  CO2 as described  earlier15. 
Harvesting of cells was performed by treatment with 0.25% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA solution (Biochrom AG). 
Change of media was done twice a week, and the cells were seeded one day prior to experiments. Experiments 
were done in triplicate.

In vitro characterization of  [99mTc]Tc(CO)3-HEHEHE-  ZVEGFR2_3gen and  [99mTc]Tc(CO)3-HEHEHE- 
 ZVEGFR2_3gen-ABD was performed as described  earlier15. Briefly, for in vitro binding specificity test MS-1 cells 
were incubated with 1 nM solution of labelled conjugates with or without pre-incubation with 100 nM solution of 
non-labelled conjugates for 1 h 37 °C. Cells were harvested and measured on activity content using an automated 
gamma well counter (3-inch NaI(Tl) detector, 2480  Wizard2, PerkinElmer).

Further, to study cellular processing, MS-1 cells were incubated with 1 nM solution of labelled conjugates 
as described  earlier15. At predetermined time points (up to 24 h), a set of dishes was treated with 0.5 mL of acid 
buffer (4 M urea in 0.2 M glycine buffer, pH 2.0) on ice for 5 min. The acid fraction was considered to represent 
the membrane bound conjugate. A base solution (NaOH, 1 M, 0.5 mL) was added to the cells and incubated 
for 30 min at 37 °C. The base solution was considered as the internalized conjugate. Activity in samples was 
measured as described above.

In vivo experiments.  All animal experiments were planned and performed in accordance with national 
legislation on laboratory animals’ protection and were approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Research 
in Uppsala. The mice were sacrificed by intraperitoneal injection of a Ketalar-Rompun solution (10 mg/mL 
Ketalar and 1 mg/mL Rompun; 20 μl of solution per gram of body weight). The tissue samples were collected for 
radioactivity measurements. The gastrointestinal tract with content and the rest of carcass were also collected. 
Activity of samples was measured together with injection standard as described above.

Female NMRI mice (n = 4) were used to study biodistribution of  [99mTc]Tc(CO)3-HEHEHE-  ZVEGFR2_3gen and 
 [99mTc]Tc(CO)3-HEHEHE-  ZVEGFR2_3gen-ABD at 2 and 24 h pi. Labelled conjugates were iv injected in equimolar 
amounts in PBS (0.3 nmol/animal in 100 µl, 30 kBq/animal at euthanisation). Additionally, one group for each 
conjugate was injected with higher protein dose, 3 nmol/animal for  [99mTc]Tc(CO)3-HEHEHE-  ZVEGFR2_3gen 
and 6 nmol for  [99mTc]Tc(CO)3-HEHEHE-  ZVEGFR2_3gen-ABD. Biodistribution in these groups was studied at 2 h 
pi for  [99mTc]Tc(CO)3-HEHEHE-  ZVEGFR2_3gen and 24 h pi for  [99mTc]Tc(CO)3-HEHEHE-  ZVEGFR2_3gen-ABD. 
Sedated animals were sacrificed by heart puncture after i.p. injection of anaesthesia solution. Dissected organs 
and tissue samples were measured on activity content as described above.

Statistical  analysis.  Statistical  analysis  was  performed  using  Prism  8.1.1  software  (GraphPad  Software 
Inc). A 2-tailed unpaired t-test was applied to find a significant difference for comparison of two sets of data.
