ABSTRACT: Building autonomous switches is an eﬀective approach for rewiring metabolic ﬂux during microbial synthesis of
chemicals. However, current autonomous switches largely rely on metabolite-responsive biosensors or quorum-sensing circuits. In
this study, a stationary phase promoter (SPP) and a protein degradation tag (PDT) were combined with the CRISPR interference
(CRISPRi) system to construct an autonomous repression system that could shut down multiple-gene expression depending on the
cellular physiological state. With this autonomous CRISPRi system to regulate one target gene, a fermenter-scale titer of shikimic
acid reached 21 g/L, which was the highest titer ever reported by Escherichia coli in a minimal medium without any chemical
inducers. With three target genes repressed, 26 g/L glutaric acid could be achieved with decreased byproduct accumulation. These
results highlight the applicability of the autonomous CRISPRi system for microbial production of value-added chemicals.

■ INTRODUCTION

With advantages including environmental
friendliness and
sustainable production, numerous microbial cell factories have
been constructed to produce value-added chemicals such as
biofuels,1 ﬁne chemicals,2 biomaterials,3 and pharmaceuticals.4
During the pathway engineering process, maximizing meta-
bolic ﬂux toward target pathways using static regulation such as
gene knock-out or overexpression always causes tremendous
cellular burden or growth retardation by draining resources
from endogenous metabolism.5 Thus, building autonomous
switches to coordinate cell growth and chemical production
can provide alternative options for improving biosynthesis
performance.6

There are mainly three approaches to achieve autonomous
metabolic ﬂux rewiring. The ﬁrst approach is using a
metabolite-biosensor-based circuit. By mining natural metab-
factors7,8 or engineering
olite-responsive transcriptional
synthetic biosensors,5 the intracellular metabolite concen-
tration signal could be autonomously converted into gene
transcriptional output to facilitate cell ﬁtness and bioproduc-
tion performance.9 For example, by installing a natural
muconic acid-responsive transcription factor CatR and an
antisense RNA system, a bifunctional dynamic control network
was recently developed for improving muconic acid biosyn-

thesis in Escherichia coli.10 However, most biosensor-based
circuits were metabolic pathway-dependent. The second
approach is the use of a quorum sensing (QS)-based circuit.
The QS system allowed microorganisms to respond to speciﬁc
signal molecules such as acyl homoserine lactone or peptides at
a speciﬁc threshold, which enabled suﬃcient biomass
accumulation before pathway ﬂux redistribution.11,12 For
instance, by integrating the QS system from Vibrio ﬁscheri
and recombinase Cre, a cell density-dependent, Cre-triggered
autonomous circuit was built
to enable the autonomous
decoupling of cell growth and shikimic acid (SA) biosyn-
thesis.13 However, building such circuits required the mining
of endogenous14 or heterologous12 QS elements. Recently, a
third approach to build autonomous biomolecular switches
was put forward. Speciﬁcally, the expression of tobacco etch
virus protease and a reporter protein was controlled by a

for alleviating metabolic stress,

Although autonomous biomolecular switches are eﬃcient
strategies
simultaneous
regulation of multiple genes remains challenging. The CRISPR
interference (CRISPRi) system contains a catalytically
deactivated Cas9 (dCas9), which lacks endonuclease activity

but retains DNA-binding activity.16 With a superior ability to
ﬁne-tune gene expression with hundreds of folds,17 CRISPRi
has been applied to control metabolic ﬂux for constructing
factories.18 Moreover, compared to other
microbial cell
dynamic control methods such as transcriptional factor-based
molecular switches,8 thermal switch systems,19 and optogenetic
circuits20 that lack multiplexed regulation ability, the CRISPRi
system enables simultaneous control of multiple genes by

The cell’s capacity to degrade pre-existing proteins during
transcriptional repression techniques has a signiﬁcant impact
on the circuit response time. For proteins with lengthy half-
lives, it may take several generations to dilute the protein to a
concentration that precludes it from functioning.21 To obtain a
quick response, numerous protein degradation tag (PDT)

variants have been generated to alter the half-life of the tagged
protein by endogenous protease ClpXP-mediated degrada-
tion.22

to achieve an autonomous switch that could shut down

■ RESULTS

Design of CRISPRi-Mediated Autonomous Repres-
sion. To construct a CRISPRi-mediated dynamic repression
system, sgRNA was designed to be expressed by a stationary
phase promoter (SPP) (Figures 1a and S2) so that the target
protein could be normally expressed at the growth phase and
repressed at the stationary phase theoretically. To achieve this
goal, 12 SPPs were screened and characterized (Figures S3 and
S4). In the control strain in which the expression of reporter
protein (mVenus) was driven by a constructive promoter PTrc,
a continuous ﬂuorescence accumulation was recorded along
with culture time. However, in the experimental strains, SPP-
controlled mVenus expression was repressed before the cell

entered the stationary phase (Figures 1b and S4). Among
those SPPs, three SPPs with diﬀerent strengths (S71, BolA,
and S143) were selected to build an SPP-based CRISPRi
circuit (SPP-CRISPRi).

Compared to the negative control strain E. coli NC that
expressed nontargeting sgRNA to allow mVenus accumulation,
approximately 26-fold repression was observed in a positive
control strain E. coli PC containing sgRNA targeting the
nontemplate strand of mVenus (Figure 1c). With negligible
pressure on cell growth by replacing SPP, three SPP-CRISPRi
including E. coli D1, D2, and D3 (with sgRNA
strains,
controlled by S71, BolA, and S143) exhibited 52.9, 20.5, and
5.4% of the reporter expression compared to that of E. coli NC,
respectively (Figure 1c,d). Moreover, the E. coli D1 strain
exhibited a close ﬂuorescence level to strain E. coli NC for
approximately 6 h, followed by gradual retardation, indicating

that target gene expression could be autonomously shut down
depending on the cellular physiological state.

To elucidate the mechanism of autonomous repression, an
real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)
test was carried out for the E. coli D1 strain and two control
strains (E. coli NC/PC) at 3 and 12 h. For sgRNA, results
showed that the transcript abundances in E. coli NC and E. coli
D1 were repressed when cells were cultured in the early period
(3 h) compared to that of E. coli PC (Figure 1e). After cells
entered the stationary phase (12 h), there was no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence between the three strains (Figure 1e). For mVenus,
coli D1 was
the transcriptional
signiﬁcantly downregulated compared to that of E. coli NC
after cells entered the stationary phase, which was diﬀerent
from that of E. coli PC that exhibited a comparable low
transcriptional level both at 3 and 12 h (Figure 1f).

level of mVenus in E.

To quantify the time ranges of mVenus switch point, sgRNA
and dCas9 were designed to be expressed under the control of
either constitutive promoters (J23101 and J23106) or three
SPPs (Figure 1g). The constructed 16 strains exhibited a
variety of switch points of the reporter protein curve, ranging
from 0.5 to 11 h. Among them, shorter switch times and lower
mVenus accumulation could be observed in higher strength
SPP combination strains. Moreover, eight strains showed a
switch time of more than 6 h, which provided alternative tools
to build a dynamic repression system (Figure 1h).

Characterization of the Autonomous Repression
System. To evaluate the tunability of the system, diﬀerent
strengths of PDTs (LAA, GSD, and DAS) that can control
protein stability to aﬀect protein half-life were fused to the
reporter protein mVenus (Figures 2a and S5). Compared to
the E. coli D1 strain that still exhibited a slight increase of
ﬂuorescence after 6 h, strains with PDTs showed similar cell
growth but suppressed the accumulation of mVenus after 6 h
(Figure S6). The abundance of mVenus in strains of E. coli D1-
LAA, D1-GSD, and D1-DAS lasted for 10, 14 h, and more than
18 h, respectively, indicating that a stronger degradation tag
could lead to less protein abundance (Figure 2b). To visually
characterize the protein expression levels in diﬀerent systems,
continuous ﬂuorescence imaging was performed at the colony
levels. In contrast to a constitutive accumulation of mVenus in
strain E. coli NC with nontargeting sgRNA, strain E. coli PC
expressing correct targeting sgRNA exhibited strong repression
of mVenus throughout the culture time. The mVenus in the
core zone of the colony was nearly completely degraded after
being cultured for 12 h in strain E. coli D1-LAA (SPP/PDT-
in strain E. coli D1 without a
CRISPRi system). However,
degradation tag (SPP-CRISPRi system), mVenus accumulated
for more than 16 h at a low but visible level. These results
revealed that proteolysis played an important role in building a
ﬁne-tuning circuit (Figure 2c).

To assess the stability of the SPP/PDT-CRISPRi system, the
abundance of mVenus in E. coli D1-LAA was detected for 96 h.
Compared to the positive control strain E. coli PC that
exhibited a low ﬂuorescence intensity throughout the 96 h
culture, mVenus in strain E. coli D1-LAA displayed a tendency
to increase ﬁrst and then decrease. Moreover, it showed a 2.6%
ﬂuorescence intensity compared to the negative control strain
E. coli NC even after 96 h. These results indicated that this
SPP/PDT-CRISPRi system was stable in long-time culture for
chemical production (Figure 2d).

To evaluate the robustness of

the SPP/PDT-CRISPRi
system, the cell growth and the ﬂuorescence proﬁle of E. coli

D1-LAA were tested in diﬀerent culture mediums. For a rich
medium (LB), the mVenus abundance of engineered strain
was
increased in the early period, while a decreased
ﬂuorescence proﬁle of engineered strain could be observed
when cells entered the stationary phase after 12 h. For the
minimal medium (M9 and NBS), similar results could be
obtained in which mVenus was gradually increased before 24 h
and then decreased after 24 h (Figure 2e).

To test the portability of the SPP/PDT-CRISPRi circuit,
mVenus was replaced by Ftsz (a key protein involved in cell
division) in an FtsZ-inactivated E. coli strain. As a result, the
mean cell length of the engineered strain was increased to 8.77
μm from 1.87 μm of the control strain (Figure S7). This result
was further conﬁrmed by a time-lapse microscopy study
(Figure 2f).

Dynamic Coordination of Cell Growth and Shikimic
Acid Production. Shikimic acid, an important building block
for
the synthesis of anti-inﬂuenza drug oseltamivir, was
traditionally obtained from Illicium plants or chemical cascade
reactions.23 Although numerous microbial cell factories have
been constructed to produce SA,13,22,24,25 current methods
depend largely on the exogenous addition of expensive
aromatic amino acids or chemical
inducers during the
fermentation process, which inevitably decreases its economic
viability. To avoid such supplementation,
the SPP/PDT-
CRISPRi system was employed to decouple cell growth and SA
production.

First, an engineered E. coli S5 was constructed from a
previous E. coli S4 by deleting quinate dehydrogenase to block
the formation of byproduct quinic acid (QA)15 (Figure 3a).
This strain could not grow normally in the minimal medium
and was selected as a chassis strain for system evaluation.
Then, by co-expression of dCas, pathway enzymes, and
sgRNA(aroK), three engineered strains including E. coli S5-
LAA, E. coli S5-GSD, and E. coli S5-DAS were constructed
(Figure 3b). Compared to the negative control strain E. coli S5
NC that exhibited normal cell growth, strains E. coli S5-DAS,
S5-GSD, and S5-LAA showed cell growth arrest at 24, 24, and
18 h, respectively. Consequently, the ﬁnal cell density of E. coli
S5-DAS, S5-GSD, and S5-LAA were reduced to 91.6, 52.4, and
35.1% from that of E. coli S5 NC, respectively (Figure 3c). The
highest shikimic acid titer of 2.8 g/L was achieved in strain E.
coli S5-DAS, with a yield of 0.22 g/g glucose (Figure 3d).

To clarify the relationship between cell growth and shikimic
acid accumulation, shikimic acid kinase activities in these
strains were measured at diﬀerent culture times. The negative
control strain E. coli S5 NC exhibited similar enzyme activities
at the exponential phase or later stationary phase. However,
strains equipped with the SPP/PDT-CRISPRi system showed
a downregulation of enzyme activities along with the culture
time (Figure 3e). This could be further veriﬁed with RT-qPCR
results, in which the transcript abundances of aroK at 24 and
36 h were reduced by 63 and 89% compared to those at 12 h,
respectively (Figure 3f).

Preliminary trials of ferment optimization showed that with
glucose as the substrate and culture at 33 °C, 2.9 g/L SA was
achieved in E. coli S5-DAS in shake ﬂask experiments (Figures
3g and S8). On this basis, E. coli S5-DAS was examined under
optimal
fermentation conditions for its scale-up in a 5 L
bioreactor. A rapid increase of SA could be detected after 12 h
when cells entered the stationary phase. After 48 h culture, the
ﬁnal titer of SA reached 21 g/L with a productivity of 0.44 g/
(L·h) (Figure 3h).

eliminating rate-limiting bottlenecks and improving the
absorption of 5AVA, an eﬃcient biocatalytic cascade for the
transformation of lysine to GA was constructed by our group.27
While GA titer was improved with lysine as a substrate, we
sought to build an engineered strain that could produce GA
directly from glucose (Figure 4a). By introducing Cad pathway
enzymes into a lysine-overproducing strain E. coli Y1, an
engineered strain E. coli G1 was constructed that could
produce 3.3 g/L GA in 60 h. However, 5.3 g/L acetic acid
(ACE), 3.8 g/L lactic acid (LAC), and 2.6 g/L formic acid
(FOR) were accumulated as well (Figure 4c).

To identify the possibility of autonomous multigene
repression to decrease byproduct accumulation during GA
production, the SPP/PDT-CRISPRi system was installed by
selecting lactate dehydrogenase (encoded by ldhA), pyruvate
formate lyase (encoded by pflB), and phosphate acetyltransfer-
ase (encoded by pta) as target sites (Figure 4b). Compared to
E. coli G1, 0.43-fold acetic acid, 0.24-fold lactic acid, and 0.15-
fold formic acid could be detected in strains with a single
targeting sgRNA. Moreover, with a multigene repression
design by assembling three sgRNA cassettes in E. coli G6,
the ﬁnal acetic acid, lactic acid, and formic acid were decreased
to 26, 34, and 31%, respectively, compared to that of E. coli G1,
indicating the versatility of the circuit (Figure 4c).

To explore the dynamic repression eﬀect on the target
lactate
enzyme, the activities of one representative enzyme,
dehydrogenase, at diﬀerent culture times were assayed in both
E. coli G1 and E. coli G6. Similar enzyme activities could be
detected in both strains within the ﬁrst 12 h culture. However,
enzyme activities in E. coli G6 started to decrease after 24 h
and were 58−24% lower than those of E. coli G1 from 24 to 60
h, respectively. These results conﬁrmed that
the targeted
enzyme could be downregulated automatically (Figure 4d).

We next tested GA production as well as the accumulation
of the byproducts in a 5 L batch bioreactor. Compared to the
control strain E. coli G1 (Figure 4e), the engineered strain E.
coli G6 exhibited a similar cell growth curve,
indicating a
negligible cell growth burden. Moreover,
three main by-
products in E. coli G6 accumulated normally until the time that
the autonomous repression system was expected to become
active and then slowed their accumulation (Figure 4f). As a
result, the maximal GA titer reached 26 g/L, and 40% acetic
acid, 41% lactic acid, and 35% formic acid were accumulated at
the end of the fermentation compared to that of E. coli G1.

■ DISCUSSION

In this study, an autonomous circuit that involved CRISPRi, a
stationary phase promoter, as well as a protein degradation tag
was successfully constructed for rewiring metabolic ﬂux. Then,
this circuit was characterized by diﬀerent aspects, including
tunability, stability, robustness, and portability. Further, this
circuit exhibited good applicability both in one target
repression for decoupling cell growth and shikimic acid
production and three target repression for decreasing by-
product accumulation during glutaric acid biosynthesis.

The introduction of SPPs to trigger the transcription of
sgRNA or dCas9 provided a valuable alternative in realizing
autonomous dynamic control. With advantages including
simple manipulation, multiplexed regulation, and high dynamic
range,
the CRISPRi system was widely implemented in
building eﬃcient microbial cell factories.28,29 For example, by
developing a tryptophan operon-assisted CRISPRi system in K.
pneumoniae, cell growth and 3-hydroxypropionic acid synthesis

were successfully decoupled.30 By integrating a blue light-
sensitive protein to control
the expression of dCpf1, an
optogenetic CRISPRi platform was constructed for improving
muconic acid production.31 If engineered strains could self-
regulate metabolic pathway ﬂuxes according to environmental
perturbations, microbial yields could be maximized without the
need for manual supervision. To achieve such autonomous
regulation, CRISPRi systems were coupled to either inter-
mediate metabolite-responsive biosensors18,32 or quorum-
sensing circuits.12,33 However, the developed approaches so
far had limitations either in pathway-independent or simple
manipulation. As the expression of phase promoters was
strictly controlled by the transcription factor σS34 or ppGpp,35
they could be recruited to construct autonomous biomolecular
switches for microbial biosynthesis. In our previous study,
diﬀerent programmable biomolecular
switches based on
stationary phase promoters or growth phase promoters were
constructed to improve the eﬃciency of shikimic acid and GA
production.15,22 Herein,
the autonomous
CRISPRi system showed that phase promoters were versatile
and could be competitive genetic parts in building smart
microorganisms.36

the success of

Protein level regulation was indispensable in realizing precise
regulation of metabolic distribution. While transcriptional
regulations are frequently used in metabolic engineering,6 their
inherent delayed response limits their wide applications in
precise metabolic ﬂux tuning. This could be veriﬁed in this
study,
in which a low level of green ﬂuorescence protein
(GFP) existed throughout the culture time even though its
transcription was terminated at the stationary phase, while no
GFP was detected in less than 10 h when it was fused with a
strong PDT. The low regulatory accuracy caused by circuit
design could result in unwanted metabolic ﬂux distribution.
For example, compared to SPP/PDT-CRISPRi that integrated
both transcriptional level and protein level regulations, higher
concentrations of byproducts could be detected when using a
single-layered transcriptional regulation (Dual-SPP-CRISPRi
system) (Figure S9). To achieve protein level regulation,
numerous endogenous proteolytic machines, such as degron-
based proteolytic machines,37 proteasome-based proteolytic
machines,38 and AAA+ proteolytic machines,39 could be used
for metabolic applications.40,41 These mechanisms, together
with suitable protein circuit design,42 would provide new
possibilities to dynamically program biological systems for
controlling cellular behaviors as well as boosting microbial
production.

Although this CRISPRi-based circuit oﬀers many advan-
tages, an important limitation of monofunction should also be
considered when applying this strategy to metabolic engineer-
ing. With a downregulation of a single target or multiple targets
at a customized time, the circuit built here could switch the cell
state only once without reversibility. To achieve multifunc-
tional regulation, four main methods could be explored. First,
with a de-repression eﬃciency of up to 95%,43 antisense RNA
could be introduced to realize the repression or de-repression
of multiple target genes simultaneously in a single-layer
regulatory circuit.44 Second, by combining the CRISPRi
system with novel biosensors that could upregulate gene
expression, a dual-control circuit could be constructed.18
Third, by engineering the dCas9 protein to be temperature-
sensitive,45 light-switchable,46,47 conditionally degradable,48
and small molecule-triggered,49 CRISPR circuits could be
reversible. Four, by integrating orthogonal CRISPR systems to

achieve both transcriptional activation50 and transcriptional
interference in one cell, a multilayer CRISPR circuit could be
constructed to perform sophisticated functions.51
■ CONCLUSIONS

Herein, we developed a tunable autonomous CRISPRi circuit
that could downregulate single or multiple genes in response to
the cell stationary phase. Application of this system with one
target repression in shikimic acid production resulted in a
decoupling of cell growth and biosynthesis, which led to the
highest titer (21 g/L) ever reported by E. coli in a minimal
medium without any aromatic amino acid or chemical inducer
supplementation. Further, by simultaneously inhibiting the
synthesis of three byproducts, including acetic acid, lactic acid,
and formic acid, the engineered E. coli could produce 26 g/L
glutaric acid using glucose as a substrate. Taken together, the
autonomous CRISPRi system oﬀers a promising option for
dynamic metabolic ﬂux coordination and will be beneﬁcial in a
variety of biotechnological applications.

■ METHODS

Strains and Plasmids. An E. coli MG1655-derived strain
S4 was selected as a starting strain for SA production.15 In this
E. coli S4, shikimic acid kinase I (encoded by aroK) and
quinate dehydrogenase (encoded by ydiB) were knocked out.
Shikimic acid kinase II (encoded by aroL) was replaced with a
tktA expression cassette. The PTS system (ptsH, ptsI, and crr,
encoding HPr, EI, and EIIAGlc, respectively) was replaced in
the genome with a glucose facilitator protein gene from Z.
mobilis. A lysine-overproducing strain E. coli Y1 was used as a
chassis strain for GA production.52 An engineered strain E. coli
Y3 with genomic phosphate acetyltransferase, pyruvate formate
lyase, and lactate dehydrogenase fused with PDT in the C-
terminal domain was constructed as the chassis strain for
system veriﬁcation. All of the strains used in this study are
listed in Table S1.

Plasmid pGABEK was used for SA production. The gene
aroGfbr, a feedback-resistant mutant involving D146N, was
obtained by rapid PCR site-directed mutagenesis. The gene
aroBopt, a codon-optimized variant, was obtained by opti-
mization of the ﬁrst eight codons. Plasmid pETM-Glu was
used for GA production,
in which ﬁve pathway enzymes,
including EcCA (GenBank: NP_418555), KpcPAE120G/T332A
(GenBank: AIA38738), KpcPD (GenBank: AIA37073),
PfeGT (GenBank: AEV60208), and PfeGD (GenBank:
AEV60207) were overexpressed in a previously constructed
plasmid pETM6R1.53 All plasmids used in this study are listed
in Table S2. To obtain suitable sgRNA for gene repression,
target enzymes were fused with the green ﬂuorescence protein
(GFP) at their C-terminal (Figure S1). A series of sgRNAs
were designed using the CRISPRdirect web (http://crispr.

and sgRNA plasmid were induced with 1 μM anhydrotetracy-
cline until the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reached 0.6
in the M9 medium. The cell ﬂuorescence was measured after
12 h of growth.

Chemicals and Mediums. All chemicals for high-perform-
ance liquid chromatography (HPLC) standards were pur-
chased from Sigma-Aldrich. For genetic experiments, strains
were cultured in LB broth or on LB agar plates; 100 mg/L

ampicillin, 50 mg/L streptomycin, and 30 mg/L chloramphe-
nicol were added for plasmid maintenance when needed.

For SA production at the shake ﬂask level, seed cultures
were grown overnight in the LB medium at 37 °C and 200 rpm
and then transferred into the NBS minimal medium (3.5 g/L

For SA production in bioreactors, the engineered strain was
ﬁrst inoculated into the LB medium at 37 °C and 200 rpm.
Then, overnight seed cultures were collected, washed, and
resuspended by the NBS minimal medium. The resulting strain
was transferred into a 5 L fermenter with the NBS minimal
medium containing 20 g/L glucose at an initial OD600 of 0.5.
The culture temperature was controlled at 33 °C. The system
·
pH was maintained at 7 by automatically feeding 30% NH3
H2O and 2 M HCl. Airﬂow was set at 1 vvm, and the dissolved
oxygen concentration was controlled above 30% saturation via
cascade agitation, and 800 g/L glucose was fed at a constant
rate of 10 mL/h when the residual glucose fell below 10 g/L.
For GA production at the shake ﬂask level, seed cultures
were grown overnight in the seed medium (4 g/L sucrose, 6 g/

OD600 of 0.35.
For GA production in bioreactors, seed cultures were grown
overnight at 37 °C. Then, this culture was inoculated into a
500 mL ﬂask containing 100 mL of second-class seed medium
(60 g/L glucose, 20 g/L (NH4)2SO4, 2 g/L K2HPO4, 2.5 g/L

Measurement of Fluorescence Intensity. E.

coli
carrying diﬀerent plasmids were ﬁrst grown in 5 mL of LB
plus antibiotics overnight at 37 °C and 200 rpm. Then, the
culture was diluted by 1:100 in 200 μL of fresh LB plus
antibiotics and grown at 30 °C, 1000 rpm in a Titramax 1000
incubator (Heidolph Instruments, Germany). The culture was
diluted 1:5 every 2 h to maintain cells in the exponential
growth phase. Samples were taken as required and further
diluted 1:10 in 200 μL of
fresh LB for ﬂuorescence
measurement using a SpectraMax M3 microplate reader
(Molecular Devices). The excitation and emission wavelengths

were set at 515 ± 10 and 544 ± 10 nm, respectively, for
mVenus.

Single-Cell Time-Lapse Fluorescence Microscopy. The
molten LB medium was poured onto a glass slide and solidiﬁed
at room temperature. Then, 1 μL of cultures were pipetted
onto an agarose pad at the center of a dish and a cover slide
was put on the top softly to prevent evaporation. The lid of the
dish was treated with an antifogging agent, sealed, and
transferred to a microscope stage in a temperature-controlled
chamber at 30 °C. Microscopy images were taken every 4 h
using a Nikon ECLIPSE 80i microscope equipped with a
Nikon DS-Ri1 camera.

RT-qPCR Analysis. Cells at diﬀerent culture periods were
harvested and washed twice using RNA-free water. After that,
the total RNA was extracted using the UNIQ-10 Trizol total
RNA Extraction Kit (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China), and
then 1 μg of total RNA was used to reverse transcription with
the Primer Script II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara,
Dalian, China). Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was
performed in a 96-well plate with a total reaction volume of
approximately 20 μL using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara,
Dalian, China) on an iQ5 continuous ﬂuorescence detector
system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Samples were prepared with
three parallel groups to obtain the results of ΔCt values. The
expression levels of diﬀerent genes were calculated and
normalized to that of rrsA.

Enzyme Activity Assay. For sample pretreatment, target
cells were centrifuged at 6000g for 10 min, washed with chilled
0.9% NaCl, and then resuspended in 0.05 M barbital buﬀer
(pH 7). The obtained cell suspensions were lysed by
sonication and centrifuged at 14 000g for 10 min. The
concentration of total cellular proteins was determined by
the Bradford method, with bovine serum albumin as a
standard.

For shikimic acid kinase assay, it was determined in crude
extracts according to a previously reported method.13 The
incubation mixture (1 mL) contained 4 μM ATP, 1 μM
shikimic acid, 10 μM NaF, 5 μM MgCl2, 25 μM barbital buﬀer
(pH 9.0), and 50 μL cell extract. One unit of shikimic acid
kinase was deﬁned as 1 μM shikimate consumed per minute.
For lactate dehydrogenase assay, cell crude extract was
assayed in a reaction mixture containing 100 mM sodium
phosphate buﬀer (pH 6.5), 80 mM pyruvate, and 4 mM
NADH. The reaction was started after adding the crude
enzyme solution at 30 °C. The change in the absorbance value
at 340 nm was measured using a UV/visible spectropho-
tometer. One unit of activity (U/mg of protein) was deﬁned as
1 mM NAD+ formed per minute per milligram of protein. All
assays were performed in triplicate.

Analytical Methods. The OD600 was measured using a
spectrophotometer. Glucose was quantiﬁed by a M-100
Biosensors Analyzer (Sieman Technology Co., Ltd). Shikimic
acid, glutaric acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, and formic acid were
determined by HPLC using an Aminex HPX-87 H column
(7.8 mm × 300 mm; Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA) at 50 °C with
5 mM sulfuric acid as the mobile phase. The injection volume
was 10 μL with a ﬂow rate of 0.6 mL/min.
