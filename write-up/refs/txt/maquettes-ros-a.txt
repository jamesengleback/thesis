Although catalytic mechanisms in natural enzymes are well understood, achieving the diverse
palette of reaction chemistries in re-engineered native proteins has proved challenging.
Wholesale modiﬁcation of natural enzymes is potentially compromised by their intrinsic
complexity, which often obscures the underlying principles governing biocatalytic efﬁciency.
The maquette approach can circumvent this complexity by combining a robust de novo
designed chassis with a design process that avoids atomistic mimicry of natural proteins.
Here, we apply this method to the construction of a highly efﬁcient, promiscuous, and
thermostable artiﬁcial enzyme that catalyzes a diverse array of substrate oxidations coupled
to the reduction of H2O2. The maquette exhibits kinetics that match and even surpass those
of certain natural peroxidases, retains its activity at elevated temperature and in the presence
of organic solvents, and provides a simple platform for interrogating catalytic intermediates
common to natural heme-containing enzymes.

Tailor-made protein catalysts that are compatible with

the natural biomolecular components of living cells are key
to realizing the ambitious goals of synthetic biology and
to the provision of cheap, green catalysts
industrial
biotechnology1–3. While there have been notable successes in
designing de novo enzymes from engineered natural protein
scaffolds4–6, the inherent complexity of evolved proteins is not a
prerequisite for sustaining sophisticated functions supporting
enzymatic catalysis and may even hinder the acquisition and
honing of enzymatic function in such proteins1–3. Indeed,
it
has been demonstrated that simple, manmade proteins can
reproduce selected functions and catalytic activities of natural
metalloenzymes7–10. Maquettes—simple
bundles
designed from ﬁrst principles3—in particular provide
a
blank canvas for tractable and iterative design processes, as
demonstrated by the successful incorporation of sophisticated
functions common to oxidoreductases such as oxygen binding11
and intermolecular electron transfer3. However, no enzymatic
activity has yet been integrated into a maquette. We recently
demonstrated that maquettes can be recognized by, and processed
through,
c maturation
machinery in the periplasmic space of E. coli to covalently graft
heme onto the maquette backbone12, 13. These c-type cytochrome
maquettes (CTMs) retain the functional legacy of their maquette
precursors (e.g., oxygen binding), while providing a robust,
functional
framework for further oxidoreductase engineering.
That the CTMs are fully and functionally assembled in vivo
affords an opportunity to examine de novo protein function
within living cells and facilitates the use of directed evolution
strategies to improve incipient function.

Here, we demonstrate the power of the maquette approach and
the utility of the CTMs through the construction of a catalytically
proﬁcient de novo enzyme. Our
strategy is based on a
simple, two-step conversion of a non-catalytic, CTM to produce a
catalytically active holoprotein from E. coli. Remarkably, this

elementary design process yields a de novo enzyme that exhibits
steady-state kinetics for oxidation and oxidative dehalogenation
that match and even surpass those of natural peroxidases, while
providing a thermostable and chemically resistant chassis for
biocatalysis.

Results
C45 design and biophysical characterization. To expand
the functional repertoire of our maquettes, we selected coupled
substrate oxidation/H2O2 reduction for inclusion into a CTM.
The natural heme-containing peroxidases that catalyze this
chemistry typically contain heme B or C axially coordinated by a
single histidine side chain14. We hypothesized that catalytic
turnover of hydrogen peroxide within a maquette scaffold could
be achieved by the construction of a monohistidine-ligated CTM
from an existing CTM scaffold. To this end, we ﬁrst selected a
CTM with heme covalently appended to helix 4 (C4) owing to its
increased thermal stability over the original parent design13. To
restrict conformational ﬂexibility and improve hydrophobic core
packing, we replaced both histidines of the second, non-covalent
tetrapyrrole-binding site with phenylalanine (C46)
(Fig. 1a,
Supplementary Fig. 1A, C, E, G), removing the capacity to bind
a second tetrapyrrole and increasing the melting transition
temperature (Tm) by 31 to 84 °C (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Subsequent replacement of the distal histidine on helix 2 with
phenylalanine yielded the monohistidine-ligated CTM C45; a
predominantly helical protein that retains the hyperthermophilic
characteristics of its precursor (Tm(C45) = 86 °C) and reversibly
refolds following thermal denaturation (Fig. 1b, c; Supplementary
Fig. 1B, D, F, H).
C45 exhibits ferric and ferrous UV/visible spectra (Fig. 1d, e)
similar to those of the monohistidine-ligated cytochrome c′15 and
horse heart cytochrome c distal methionine mutants16, suggesting
either a quantum mechanical admixture of

Fig. 1 Design and characterization of an artiﬁcial peroxidase. a The design process begins with C4, a CTM containing a bis-histidine heme C-binding site
with the consensus motif for covalent heme incorporation on helix 4 with the distal histidine heme ligand on helix 2, and a second non-covalent
tetrapyrrole-binding site (occluded by helix 2) consisting of a bis-histidine pair on helices 1 and 3. Mutation of both histidines of the non-covalent-binding
site to phenylalanine produces the CTM, C46. Subsequent mutation of the distal heme C-ligating histidine ligand results in the mono-histidine ligated
C45. Puriﬁcation data are displayed in Supplementary Fig. 1. b Far-UV circular dichroism spectra of C45 with varying temperature collected in 100 mM KCl,

high-spin states exists at the heme iron17 or a titratable water
molecule occupies the vacant axial coordination site18, 19. The
ferric C45 spectrum is pH dependent (Supplementary Fig. 3A, B),
yielding a pKa of 8.11 for the transition between spectra at neutral
and alkaline pH (pH 6.5–11), similar to the acid-alkaline
transition pKa of horse heart myoglobin (pKa = 8.9)18 and
indicative of a heme C-bound water molecule occupying
the available axial heme ligation site. C45 displays a marked
pH-dependence in its heme redox potential (Supplementary
Fig. 3C–E), increasing from −208 mV at pH 10 to −174 mV at pH
8.6. At pH 7.5 two redox potentials are observed, likely reﬂecting
a mixture of spin states and the water/hydroxide equilibrium
at the distal coordination site. The exogenous diatomic ligand-
binding function of its CTM precursors12, 13 is retained in C45: it
readily binds carbon monoxide and oxygen in the ferrous form,
and cyanide in the ferric form (Supplementary Fig. 4A, B). The
ability to bind oxygen is strongly indicative of the retention, from
previous designs, of a relatively dry and conformationally stable
oxygen-binding site on the distal heme face11, 12. O2 binds 10-fold
more rapidly to C45 than the bis-histidine ligated C413

Steady-state kinetics and substrate promiscuity of C45.
When rapidly mixed with hydrogen peroxide and the classical
peroxidase substrate ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazo-
line-6-sulfonic acid))14, C46 very slowly bleaches indicating
heme degradation with no evidence of
spectroscopically
isolable intermediates and little oxidized ABTS product. In
contrast, when rapidly mixed with hydrogen peroxide,
the
monohistidine-ligated ferric C45 rapidly reacts with ABTS to
form the green ABTS radical cation (Fig. 2a, Supplementary
Fig. 5A). At the optimum reaction pH (pH = 8.58, Supplementary
Fig. 6A, B) the reaction between C45 and H2O2/ABTS follows the
ping-pong steady-state kinetics typical of natural peroxidases20

matches well that of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) operating at
its optimal pH (kcat = 4100 s−1; Km(ABTS) = 800 μM; kcat/
Km(ABTS) = 5.13 × 106 M−1 s−1)21. Despite the high efﬁciency of
the electron transfer step, the activation of peroxide by C45 is less
catalytically efﬁcient than in HRP (C45 kcat/Km = 1.3 × 104 M−1 s
−1; HRP kcat/Km = 4.6 × 106 M−1 s−1 at pH 7.5)22, and is likely due
to the lack of peroxide-activating amino acid side chains in the

Previous work by Fry et al.26 has illustrated that heme
maquettes can undergo rapid interprotein electron transfer with
natural proteins such as cytochrome c, facilitated by comple-
mentary surface electrostatic interactions. Since C45 presents
similar electrostatic surfaces to these maquettes, we reasoned
that ferrous cytochrome c could act as an electron donor in
the peroxidase reaction with C45, reproducing the activity of the
natural cytochrome c peroxidases14. C45 is indeed capable of
functioning as an efﬁcient artiﬁcial cytochrome c peroxidase
(Fig. 3a, b; Supplementary Fig. 5B), though the high Km(H2O2) of
C45 precludes the determination of precise enzyme mechanism
due to the high background rate of
ferrous cytochrome c
oxidation at millimolar H2O2 concentrations. We therefore ﬁt the
data to a simple Michaelis–Menten steady-state model with kcat
here representing the observed maximum rate constant at
limiting H2O2 concentration (100 μM). C45 exhibits impressive
catalytic efﬁciency at limiting H2O2 concentrations (kcat/Km(cytc)
= 4.3 × 105 M−1 s−1
for
the natural yeast cytochrome c peroxidase27); however, under
non-limiting concentrations of peroxide, we predict that kcat and

substrate promiscuity:

Much like the natural heme-containing peroxidases14, C45
exhibits
the
oxidation of peroxidase substrates including guaiacol, p-anisidine,
o-phenylenediamine, 5-aminosalicylic acid, luminol, reactive blue
4, reactive black 5, and the anti-tuberculosis prodrug, isoniazid
(Supplementary Fig. 8). This catalytic promiscuity also extends to
the oxidative dehalogenation of halogenated phenols such as
2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) (Supplementary Fig. 5C) and its
bromo-analog and ﬂuoro-analog, and 4-bromophenol. Like the
ferrous cytochrome c oxidation described above, the mechanistic
interrogation of TCP dehalogenation by C45 and H2O2 is
hampered by the high C45 Km(H2O2) and incompatibility of the
assay with millimolar [H2O2], and the data were therefore
analyzed using a simple Michaelis–Menten model (Fig. 3c, d) at a
limiting hydrogen peroxide concentration (100 μM). Compared
to the dehaloperoxidase from Amphitrite ornata29, an enzyme

also to be signiﬁcantly higher than for the natural enzyme.

the calculations indicate that ABTS may bind in up to 10 sites on

Discussion
Our simple, systematic construction of a functional de novo
enzyme highlights the power and utility of the maquette approach
to functional oxidoreductase design. Similar to the construction
of the original oxygen-binding maquette11, the engineering steps
required to attain the desired catalytic function in this simple
protein scaffold are few in number, reﬂecting the relative
ease with which evolutionarily naive proteins can be rationally
engineered in a tractable,
iterative process. In this case, the
concomitant restriction of conformational ﬂexibility and removal
of a heme ligand were sufﬁcient to attain efﬁcient, multistep
catalysis within a heat-resistant and solvent-resistant maquette
chassis, representing just three amino acid substitutions from the
oxygen-binding progenitor. Despite the relatively low-catalytic
efﬁciency of hydrogen peroxide turnover (104 M−1 s−1),
the
enzymatic rate constant kcat(ABTS) is among the highest yet
observed in a de novo enzyme, and kcat/Km(ABTS) is greater than
the catalytic efﬁciencies of the best reported de novo enzymes5, 8.
Given the lack of a highly speciﬁc substrate-binding site,
it
is perhaps unsurprising that C45 exhibits broad substrate
promiscuity. However, this catalytic promiscuity may be a general
feature of primitive, nascent enzymes43. Since C45 is fully
assembled in vivo, there is now a tantalizing opportunity to
employ both rational protein design and directed evolution
methodologies to optimize the catalytic chassis toward a selected
substrate or chemical mechanism. We therefore anticipate that
the descendants of this de novo designed enzyme will act as
cheap, green, and catalytically proﬁcient catalysts for industrial
biotechnology and versatile bioblocks for synthetic biology, while

Methods
General. All chemicals were purchased from either Sigma or Fisher Scientiﬁc, and
T7 Express competent cells and Q5 polymerase were purchased from NEB.

Molecular biology, protein expression, and puriﬁcation. Mutagenesis was
performed using the ligase-independent cloning/mutagenesis method of Tillett44.
Artiﬁcial CTMs were puriﬁed from E. coli using established procedures12, 13.
To inhibit proteolysis, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl ﬂuoride was added to the
resuspended cell pellets. These cell pastes were then lysed by sonication (Soniprep
plus MSE) and the soluble lysate was collected by centrifugation (40,000 × g for 30
min). This was then ﬁltered (0.22 μM syringe ﬁlter, Millipore) and applied to a 5 ml
HisTrap HP IMAC column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 40 mM imidazole,
300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Potassium Phosphate at pH 8.0 (lysis buffer). The bound
protein was then washed with lysis buffer (50 ml) and eluted with a linear gradient
(0–100%) of 250 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Potassium Phosphate at
pH 8.0 (elution buffer). SDS PAGE gel analysis revealed the cleanest fractions from
the column, which were subsequently pooled and dialysed for 16 h against 5 liters
of 0.5 mM EDTA and 20 mM Tris pH 8.0 in a 3 kDa semi-permeable dialysis
membrane. 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) or dithiothreitol (DTT)
was then added to the dialysed protein and TEV protease (1 μM) was added under
anaerobic conditions (Belle Technology Glove Box, <5 p.p.m. O2) to facilitate
cleavage of the N-terminal hexahistidine tag. Cleavage was complete after 5 h, and
the protein was centrifuged (4000 × g, 10 min) and ﬁltered (0.22 μM syringe ﬁlter,
Millipore) to remove precipitated TEV protease. The protein was then loaded onto
a HisTrap IMAC column equilibrated with lysis buffer as described above. Protein
lacking the N-terminal hexahistidine tag eluted in the column ﬂow through and
was then placed in centrifugal concentrators (10 kDa Vivaspin Sartorius Stedim) to
sufﬁciently increase concentration for the subsequent puriﬁcation steps.

If HPLC-puriﬁcation was required, the following procedure was followed using
a Varian SD HPLC system: a C-18 reversed-phase HPLC column (Phenomenex)
was equilibrated with 30% acetonitrile: 70% water (both with 0.1% triﬂuoroacetic
acid). Samples (0.5 ml) were then loaded on the column at 5 ml/min and following
application of 25 ml of 30% acetonitrile, a linear gradient of 30–55% acetonitrile
was applied. Absorbance was monitored at 280 and 395 nm to enable assessment of
protein and heme content of the eluted fractions. Fractions containing the highest
heme:protein ratio from a single peak were pooled and lyophilized to remove

acetronitrile and triﬂuoroacetic acid. Proteins were then resuspended in
appropriate buffer as stated in the respective methods.

Alternatively, it was found that size-exclusion chromatography was sufﬁcient
to produce clean CTM samples. Therefore, if HPLC was not employed, then the
following procedure was followed: CTM samples were concentrated to
approximately 1.5 ml with a centrifugal concentrator (10 kDa Vivaspin Sartorius
Stedim) and split into three 0.5 ml samples that were loaded in separate runs onto a
HiLoad Superdex 75 PG column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 100 mM KCl, 20
mM CHES, pH 8.58, and ﬂowing at 1 ml/min. Samples eluted in two distinct peaks,
the ﬁrst was aggregated protein and the second was pure maquette. The maquette
peak was collected, concentrated to approximately 300 μM, and stored at 4 °C for
further analysis.

Electronic spectroscopy and stopped-ﬂow spectrophotometry. All UV-visible
spectra were recorded on an Agilent Cary-60 UV-visible spectrophotometer. CTM
samples were reduced by the addition of a few grains of sodium dithionite. To
conﬁrm the presence of c-type heme and to enable accurate determination of heme
extinction coefﬁcients, the pyridine hemochrome method of Berry et al.45 was
employed. Using the pyridine hemichrome and hemochrome ε550 nm (32,700 and
8430 M−1 cm−1), extinction coefﬁcients of ε406 nm = 147,300 M−1 cm−1 and ε420 nm
= 119,900 M−1 cm−1 were determined for the ferric and ferrous C45 Soret
absorption bands.

To examine the pH-dependence of the ferric UV/visible spectrum of C45, 5 μM
samples of C45 were prepared at pHs between pH 6.5 and 11.0. For pHs 6.0–6.5,
7.0–8.25, 8.5–10, and 10.5–11.0, the buffers employed were Bis-Tris, Tris, CHES,
and CAPS, respectively, all at 50 mM. UV/visible spectra of the samples were
measured and the Soret λmax was subsequently plotted vs. pH and ﬁtted to a double
ionization model yielding two pKa values.

Oxygen-binding kinetics of C45 were determined using a SX20 Stopped Flow
Spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics) housed in an anaerobic glove box
under N2 ([O2] <5 p.p.m.; Belle Technology). C45 samples (5 μM) in 100 mM KCl,
20 mM CHES, pH 8.58 were passively degassed in the anaerobic box overnight and
then reduced with a stoichiometric quantity of sodium dithionite. Using the
stopped ﬂow spectrophotometer, ferrous C45 was then rapidly mixed with
oxygenated buffer (540 μM O2 in 100 mM KCl, 20 mM CHES, pH 8.58) at 15 °C.
Oxygen concentration was determined using a Lutron PDO-520 oxygen probe. Full
spectra were collected over 1 or 100 s using a diode array detector, and a single
wavelength corresponding to oxyferrous C45 (569 nm) was plotted against time.
This trace was then ﬁt to two consecutive single exponential functions representing
the formation of the oxyferrous complex (0–0.04 s) and its subsequent autoxidation
(0.04–100 s).
mixing 2 mM H2O2 or 2 mM peracetic acid with 20 μM ferric C45 (in 100 mM
KCl, 20 mM CHES, pH 8.58) using an SX20 Stopped Flow Spectrophotometer
(Applied Photophysics) at 5 °C. Full UV/visible spectra were collected for at least
10 s after mixing.

Possible reactive intermediates in C45 catalysis were generated by rapidly

Circular dichroism spectroscopy. A JASCO J-815 CD polarimeter was
used to measure circular dichroism spectra. Samples were typically loaded at
concentrations of 0.015–0.15 mg/ml (1–10 μM) in 100 mM KCl, 20 mM CHES, pH
8.58 into a 1 mm pathlength quartz cell. Far-UV CD spectra were recorded at
100 nm/min with a sensitivity of 50 mdeg. To assess the thermal stability of the
proteins, a ramp rate of 40 °C/h with 1 °C intervals was used and the ellipticity
at 222 nm was measured throughout. The raw data were converted to mean
residue ellipticity using the protein concentration and cell pathlength. The thermal
denaturation midpoints (Tms) were assessed by plotting the second derivatives of
the denaturation traces, the x-axis intercept corresponding to the Tm.

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Solutions of 0.5 mM CTM were
prepared in redox buffer containing 10% v/v D2O (Sigma Aldrich, UK). 1D and 2D
1H-15N SOFAST HMQC spectra46 were acquired using a Shigemi tube (Sigma
Aldrich, UK) on 30 μl of this solution using a 700 MHz Bruker AVANCE HD
NMR spectrometer equipped with a 1.7 mm microcryo-coil triple resonance probe.
15N-enriched C45 was prepared by adding 1 g of 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotopes) to
1 liter of LB culture medium at the point of induction with isopropyl β-D-1-
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), following the procedure described above. It should
be noted that we were unable to obtain holoprotein with heme C covalently
attached when attempting to isotopically label C45 in minimal medium. Deme-
tallated C45 was obtained using the HF:pyridine method as described previously12.

EPR spectroscopy. Hydrogen peroxide or peracetic acid (1 mM) was added to C45
(700 μM in 100 mM KCl, 20 mM CHES, pH 8.58) in suprasil quartz sample tubes
and ﬂash frozen. X-band cw-EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker eleXsys
E500 spectrometer using a standard rectangular Bruker EPR cavity (ER4102T)
equipped with an Oxford helium cryostat (ESR900). Experimental parameters:
microwave power, 1 mW; ﬁeld modulation amplitude, 3 G; ﬁeld modulation
frequency, 100 kHz; measuring time 160 s; temperature 12 K. Q-band cw-EPR
spectra were performed on a Bruker eleXsys E-560 spectrometer using a ER
5106QT-W1 resonator equipped with a home-built ARS cryogen-free cryostat.

The measured spectra were corrected for an offset against a known g standard
[1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl, g = 2.00351 ± 0.00002]. Spectral simulations were
performed using the Matlab-based Easyspin package47.

Redox potentiometry. OTTLE potentiometry48 was used to measure heme redox
potentials. CTMs (50–100 μM) were exchanged into 500 mM KCl, 10% glycerol,
100 mM KCl, 20 mM CHES, pH 8.58 and redox mediators (20 μM benzyl viologen,
20 μM anthroquinone-2-sulfonate, 20 μM phenazine, 25 μM 2-hydroxy-1,4-nap-
thoquinone, 6 μM indigotrisulfonate, and 50 μM duroquinone) were added to
facilitate equilibration between the electrodes and the redox cofactor. A home-built
OTTLE cell was used for the measurements as previously described13, 48, consisting
of a modiﬁed ﬂat, quartz EPR tube (Wilmad, USA) with a platinum gauze working
electrode, platinum counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode (BASi,
USA). A Biologic SP-150 potentiostat was used to apply potentials across the cell
(+50 to −350 mV vs. NHE) in both reductive and oxidative directions to conﬁrm
equilibration, as evidenced by the lack of hysteresis in the data. To determine the
heme reduction potentials, the wavelength corresponding to the heme Soret λmax
was plotted against the applied potential and the data were subsequently ﬁtted to
functions corresponding to a single electron (Eq. (1)) or 2 × single electron (Eq. (2))

In Eq. (1), A and B are y-axis values at 100% oxidized and reduced heme

respectively; Em is the heme reduction potential. In Eq. (2), A and C are y-axis
values at 100% oxidized and reduced heme, respectively, and B represents the point
on the y-axis where there is a changeover between absorbance contributions from
the ﬁrst and second electron processes; Em1 and Em2 are the heme reduction
potentials.

Steady-state kinetics. Steady-state kinetics of ABTS oxidation by C45 and H2O2
(where [ABTS] was varied) were carried out either in a 1 ml cuvette using an
Agilent Cary-60 UV-visible spectrometer or on 96-well plate format (total volume
per well = 300 μl) using a CLARIOstar plate reader (BMG Labtech). Unless spe-
ciﬁed, all enzymatic assays were carried out at 25 °C; enzymatic assays at elevated
temperature were carried out in 1 ml cuvettes using an Agilent Cary-60 UV/visible
spectrometer equipped with a TC 1 Peltier and BATH 10 circulator (Quantum
Northwest). For assays conducted using the CLARIOstar plate reader, solutions of
C45 and ABTS were prepared in a Sterilin 96-well plate (Thermo Fisher) at varying
[ABTS] using a robotic liquid handling platform (Tecan). In all cases, reactions
were initiated by the addition of H2O2 and the formation of the ABTS radical
cation was monitored at 405 nm (ε405 nm = 36,800 M−1 cm−1)49. Steady-state
kinetics of H2O2 reduction by C45 and ABTS (where [H2O2] was varied) were
carried out using a SX20 (Applied Photophysics) or HI-TECH SF-61DX2
Stopped Flow Spectrophotometer as the reaction rates were too rapid to enable
measurement on a plate reader or in the standard 1 ml cuvette methods
described above. 0.1 μM C45 and 24 mM ABTS (in 20 mM CHES, 100 mM KCl,
pH 8.58) were rapidly mixed with varying concentrations of H2O2 between 0 and 1
M. The formation of the ABTS radical cation was followed at 525 nm (ε525 nm =
4250 M−1 cm−1). Data were recorded in triplicate and ﬁt to a ping pong steady-state
model (Eq. (3)) using the Dynaﬁt software package50.

To determine the pH optimum and corresponding pKa’s, ABTS oxidation
kinetics were obtained at pH 6, 7, 8 (20 mM Potassium Phosphate), 8.5, 9, 10
(20 mM CHES), and 11 (20 mM CAPS). Data were ﬁt to a double ionization model
as described above.

Ferrocytochrome c was produced by reducing horse heart cytochrome c with
sodium dithionite. Excess dithionite was removed using a PD-10 desalting column
(GE Healthcare) and the concentration of ferrocytochrome c was determined using
ε550 nm = 29,500 M−1 cm−1. The reaction kinetics were determined pH 8.58 by
monitoring the disappearance of the cytochrome alpha band at 550 nm and data
were ﬁt to a simple Michaelis–Menten steady-state model.

A stock solution of TCP was prepared by dissolving 2 mg of TCP in 100%

ethanol and then the required TCP concentrations were obtained through
serial dilution. TCP concentrations were determined using the extinction
coefﬁcient at 312 nm (ε312 nm = 5290 M−1 cm−1)51. Steady-state kinetics were
recorded at pH 8.58 as described above for ABTS. The reaction kinetics
were determined by monitoring the formation of the dichloroquinone product
(ε272 nm (of DCQ—TCP) = 11,670 M−1 cm−1) and the kinetic data were ﬁt to a
simple Michaelis–Menten steady-state model.

To determine the effects of organic solvents, ABTS oxidation and TCP oxidative

dehalogenation were carried out in the presence of increasing concentrations of
ethanol and methanol, respectively. Data were collected and analyzed as described
above.

Computational methods. MD simulations of C45 were performed using
GROMACS 4.6.4 (www.gromacs.org) running on local workstations and the
University of Bristol HPC BlueCrystal. Gromacs tools were used to add hydrogen
atoms consistent with pH 7, set up a cubic periodic box 0.18 nm large than the
largest dimension of the protein and solvate the box with TIP3P water and 150 mM
sodium chloride ions, ensuring overall charge neutrality. The CHARMM27 force
ﬁeld was modiﬁed to include heme C parameters, derived from the standard
CHARMM heme B parameters52. An initial energy minimization was performed
using steepest descents until the maximum force on any atom was less than 200 kJ
mol−1 nm−1. Long-range electrostatics were treated with particle mesh Ewald
(PME) and simulations performed as isothermal–isobaric ensemble (NPT)
ensembles at 300 K and 1 bar maintained with v-rescale temperature coupling and
isotropic Berendsen pressure coupling. An equilibration simulation was performed
for 200 ps while restraining the protein atoms to their original positions.
After removing restraints, the simulation was continued for 100 ns saving frames
every 1 ns. Analysis and visualization was performed with the Gromacs tools and
Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD).

BUDE surface scanning mode was used for the C45 substrates ABTS and TCP
on 10 different snapshots from a Gromacs MD simulation of C45. The snapshots
were taken every 10 ns during the 100 ns simulation. The structures of the ligands
were obtained from the ZINC database online and parameterized with the program
acpype.py using Antechamber and the General Amber Force Field53–55. The BUDE
setup, BUDE running, processing for MD, MD setup, and MD post-processing was
scripted where appropriate. Each combination of ligand and snapshot of
C45 simulation (receptor) had 1200 randomly assigned surface positions
explored. At each surface position the ligand was docked using the BUDE EMC
method (a cut-down GA) whereby 3000 initial poses were developed for a further
10 generations, expanding the 30 best parents to 3000 children each generation. In
total 1.08 × 1010 conformations were sampled per ligand with C45. The top 50
binding modes per ligand were then processed and run as a 10 ns Gromacs
simulations as described above.

Data availability. All data are available from the authors upon reasonable request.
