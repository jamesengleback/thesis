With the development of enzyme engineering technology, green enzyme catalysis is widely poised to replace 
traditional chemical catalysis enabling high enantioselectivity and yielding chiral chemicals. However, some 
inherent drawbacks still restrict natural enzymes in these applications e.g., enzyme instability, low activity, 
limited substrate spectra. Herein, protein engineering was exhibited powerful means to reconstruct natural en-
zymes for promising enzymes with industrial values. Many enzyme engineering design strategies have emerged 
in recent years (e.g., directed evolution, semi-rational design, artificial synthesis, Computer-Assisted Design 
(CAD), artificial intelligence) to generate enzymatic diversity and abundance for needs. This review introduces 
the development of these protein engineering design strategies. This works primarily focus as upon the appli-
cation of semi-rational design based on sequence information and protein structure, and artificial intelligence 
through deep learning algorithms altering the function of natural enzymes to obtain superior functionality and 
specificity industrial enzymes.   

1. Introduction 

As known, due to functionality and specificity of applications, en-
zymes own critical values in food, medicine, biofuels, chemical raw 
materials, and related fields. In particular, enzymes also play a crucial 
role in biocatalytic production of chiral chemicals [1–3]. Enzymatic 
reactions  have  gradually  replaced  traditional  chemical  reactions  in 
catalytic systems due to inherent advantages of high selectivity, envi-
ronmental friendliness, mild reaction conditions, and simplicity of re-
action  steps.  The  combination  of  biotechnology  and  computer 
technology has significantly improved the development of related bio-
logical disciplines, resulting in a more comprehensive and systematic 
understanding of the relationship between protein structure and func-
tion. Although enzymes have tremendous potential in biocatalytic syn-
thesis,  natural  enzymes  have  inherent  defects,  such  as  low  enzyme 
activity,  instability,  limited  substrate  range,  and  low  selectivity  of 
reactivity. The two most effective ways to solve these problems are 
locating novel enzymes with specific functionality in diverse environ-
ments or modifying existing enzymes to obtain particular desired func-
tionality.  Compared  to 
locating  new  enzymes,  it  is  relatively 
straightforward to transform natural enzymes at the molecular level, 
thus protein engineering came into being. 

Protein engineering is a powerful tool to modify the structure of 
enzymes to guarantee a change of enzyme function for practice. Since 
the concept of protein proposed by Swedish chemist Jacob Berzelius in 
1835 to Frances Arnold’s “directed evolution of enzymes” awarded the 
Nobel Prize for the in 2018, protein engineering has been developed for 
nearly  two  centuries.  Protein  engineering  has  been  widely  used  to 
improve the specificity, regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of enzyme 
protein, as well as the thermostability and solvent tolerance of enzyme 
protein. With industrial perspectives of green sustainable biocatalysis, 
gradually increasing number of engineered enzymes have been used to 
synthesized  non-natural  clinical  medicine  intermediates  and  fine 
chemical products. The application of artificial intelligence to protein 
engineering  has  also  been  established  [4]  and  many  protein  design 
strategies have been conceived throughout this long historical process 
including directed evolution, rational design, semi-rational design, and 
computer-assisted design (CAD). The schematics of development process 
is shown in Fig. 1. 
2. Directed evolution 

The  concept  of  directed  evolution  emerged  as  early  as  the  20th 
century. More recently, Frances H. Arnold won the 2018 Nobel Prize in

methods, which inevitably leads to a difficult task for certain target 
protein. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that directed evolution technol-
ogy is still a powerful tool in modifying protein function. 
3. Semi-rational design 

W. Xiong et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
chemistry due to significant contribution to widely develop the directed 
evolution  of  enzymes.  Directed  evolution  aims  to  simulate  the 
Darwinian evolution process in a test tube. Abundant and diverse mu-
tants are artificially created through random mutations. These mutants 
are subsequently screened according to specific metrics with the goal of 
transforming proteins to obtain the specific functionality [5]. Directed 
evolution is highly efficient as it enables the introduction of random 
mutations without understanding the underlying structure and function 
of the enzyme and the catalytic mechanism. As a matter of fact, statis-
tical  analysis  upon  thousands  of  items  in  literature  regarding  the 
directed evolution of enzymes could be exhibited as indicated in Fig. 2. 
For  decades,  scientists  have  adopted  directed  evolution  of  trans-
forming natural enzymes to study for instance catalytic mechanisms, 
metabolic pathways, enzymatic properties of enzymes. The statistical 
analysis could clearly reveal that directed evolution is a powerful and 
dominant means of transforming enzymes to obtain superior enzymatic 
functionality. Directed evolution primarily uses random mutation and 
recombination techniques to  create mutants.  These methods  include 
error-prone PCR [6], sequence homology-independent protein recom-
bination  (SHIPREC)  [7],  incremental  truncation  for  the  creation  of 
hybrid enzymes (ITCHY) [8], recombining the genes by restriction and 
relegation 
[10], 
random-priming recombination (RPR) [11], and DNA shuffling [12]. 
The directed evolution of random mutation combined with high- 
throughput screening has significantly improved enzyme activity and 
widened its application in industrial catalysis. A typical example would 
be the directed evolution developed in 1993 by Arnold’s team. A mutant 
subtilisin  E  containing  six  mutation  sites  was  constructed  via  error- 
prone  PCR  and  high-throughput  screening  method.  This  mutant 
exhibited 256-fold higher compared to the wild-type (WT) in 60% DMF 
solvent [13]. This milestone example demonstrated that random muta-
tion of enzyme’s gene sequence could significantly improve the per-
formance of enzyme. In subsequent years, A large number of directed 
evolutionary strategies for combining gene recombination were gradu-
ally developed. One such example is the staggered extension process 
(StEP) for creating mutant via gene recombination. After two rounds of 
mutant libraries constructed with this method and screening, a mutant 
subtilisin  E  was  identified  via  four  point  mutation  that  exhibited  a 
50-fold increase in half-life compared to the wild type at 65 ℃ [10]. The 
other example is DNA shuffling for in vitro homologous gene recombi-
nation from different organisms. Miho Kikuchi et al. [12] reported an in 
vitro gene recombination novel method called DNA shuffling. It can use 
single-stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) as template to improve the efficiency of 
hybridization formation in family shuffling. Of course, directed evolu-
tion requires the construction of statistically significant number of gene 

In fact, enzyme engineering by directed evolution still depends on an 
iterative two-step process. Random mutations first generate the molec-
ular diversity and in vitro recombination, the target protein is screened 
from  a  large  number  of  libraries  by  the  high-throughput  screening 
method. This approach requires a large amount of work, material, and 
financial resources to select the desired phenotype. It is still significantly 
challenging to complete the comprehensive search of sequence space for 
an  average  protein.  Many  researchers  have  sought  methods  beyond 
traditional  directed  evolution,  and  thus  simple  and  efficient  semi- 
rational  design  and  computational  protein  design  (CPD)  strategies 
were born [14]. 
Semi-rational design strategy is based on the structural information 
of enzyme protein, combined with the analysis of conserved amino acid 
sequence. It focuses on specific amino acid positions to create a small 
and precise mutation library. A significant advantage of this method is 
convenient to screen target protein from small and accurate mutation 
samples, thus avoiding the time-consuming and labor-consuming high- 
throughput  assay  process.  Of  course,  the  limitation  of  semi-rational 
design lies  in the need  for accurate structural information,  focusing 
only  on  conserved  amino  acid  sites  and  missing  non-conserved  se-
quences related to catalytic function. Currently, the semi-rational design 
strategy is generally based on two distinct methodologies: sequence- 
based enzyme redesign and structure-based enzyme redesign, with the 
specific methods shown in Fig. 3. 
The former aims to locate the critical conserved residues binding to 
substrate through multiple sequence alignments (MSA) of homologous 
protein sequences. Structural analysis infers the essential interactions 
with substrate or cofactors for predicting functional hot spots [15–18]. 
Its potential benefits of enzyme engineering could be elucidated in three 
following  examples.  Kataoka  and  co-workers  performed  multiple 
sequence alignment of phenylalanine (PheDH), glutamate (GluDH), and 
leucine dehydrogenase (LeuDH) to determine key substrate binding sites 
of LeuDH. The variant A113G/V291S successfully expanded the sub-
strate spectrum, and increased enzyme activity 130-fold compared with 
the wild type for methionine as the substrate [19]. Nakano et al. iden-
tified two critical residues through D-lactate dehydrogenase sequence 
alignment.  As  a  result,  variant  T75L/  A234S  was  constructed  and 
showed 6.8-fold enhanced catalytic efficiency compared with wild type

[20].  Recently,  Jianhe  Xu  developed  a  cofactor  specificity  reversal 
strategy  (e.g.,  small  smart  library  design  (CSR-SaSLid)).  It  aims  to 
change the coenzyme preference of 7β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 
from Ruminococcus torques (Rt7β-HSDH) by constructing a small and 
precise mutation library based on homologous sequence alignment. In 
this strategy, the binding domain of the 7β-HSDH enzyme and coenzyme 
2′-  phosphate  (β2α3)  was  analyzed  through  MSA  of  homologous 
7β-HSDH sequence with different nicotinamide coenzyme preferences. 
The  double  mutant  G39D/T17A  was  precisely  constructed,  which 
reversed  NAD(P)H’s  preference  and  increased  the  enzyme  activity 

223-fold for the biocatalytic synthesis of ursodeoxycholic acid [21]. 
These  examples  all  suggested  the  successful  application  of  a 
semi-rational design strategy based on sequence-based enzyme redesign 
to  pinpoint  functional  hot  spots  for  improving  activity,  selectivity, 
substrate spectral specificities, and changing coenzyme preference. 
In general, enzyme function is linked to the sequence of amino acids 
and closely related to the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme. 
The  second  method  of  semi-rational  design  is  based  on  three- 
dimensional structure design using various available docking software 
with analysis of the substrate, transition state or product binding in the 

BiochemicalEngineeringJournal174(2021)1080963W. Xiong et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
active site to more effectively pinpoint the functional hot spots that may 
control  the  reaction  [16,22,23].  For  example,  Gong  and  co-workers 
obtained the multi-docking sites by docking the cyclohexylamine oxi-
dase (CHAO) with D-valine, D-phenylalanine, and L-valine ethyl ester 
using  Autodock  software.  Through  site-directed  mutagenesis  and 
screening Y32I/ M226T, the resultant catalytic efficiency of D-valine 
was 30 times higher than that of the wild-type. The yield and ee value of 
D-valine reached 95% and 99%, respectively [24]. 
In addition, Tournier and co-workers used molecular docking and 
surface analysis methods to study the interaction of leaf-branch compost 
cutinase (LCC) (protein database (PDB ID: 4EB0)) with its substrate 
mono (2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (2-HE (MHET)3). The satu-
rated mutations of four sites were screened from candidates of 15 critical 
amino acids, and disulfide bonds were introduced at 238 and 283 sites of 
mutants. Finally, the best variants F243I/D238C/S283C/Y127G (ICCG) 
and F243W/D238C/S283C/Y127G (WCCG) could be stably screened. 
After process optimization, ICCG and WCCG mutants were found to 
reach 90% degradation rates within 9.3 h and 10.5 h, respectively. The 
mutant enzymes successfully catalyzed the degradation of 1000 kg of 
waste PET to obtain 863 kg of terephthalic acid. This structure-based 
design strategy has become an effective method to tailor the biocata-
lyst of LCC to help solve the issue of plastic pollution, a significant issue 
that humanity has faced for a long time [25]. 

discover inhibitors  and virtual screening of antibodies based  on the 
structure. The screening results found 30 active candidate ingredients, 
including  Indinavir,  Lopinavir,  and  Ritonavir,  which  have  potential 
therapeutic effects on COVID-19. That is, CAD has inevitably become an 
essential tool in the development of vaccines. [28–31]. 
Both CAD and semi-rational design are based on the in-depth un-
derstanding  of  the  relationship  between  protein  structure  and  func-
tionality, enabling proteins to be tailored to obtain specific functions by 
using a variety of computing tools. Table 2 introduces the most popular 
protein design engineering software in recent years. 
Aside from the synthesis of unnatural compounds, existing natural 
and  engineered  enzymes  have  gradually  failed  to  meet  our  needs, 
therefore alterations of the de novo design of proteins have been paid for 
study. The following table lists some computer-assisted de novo protein 
design cases over decades (Table 3). 
Recently  utilized protein  computing designing  software  predomi-
nantly includes Rosetta design [32], Transcent [33], Tinker [34], IPRO 
[35], and Osprey [36]. According to the protein structure and function 
analysis, multiple peptide Motifs were explored to determine protein 
function. Therefore, the difficulty and challenges of computer design of 
proteins with unknown functions would come from the comprehensive 
search of protein sequence space. For example, attempts to change co-
enzyme or substrate preferences have been successful in many cases 
[37–40]. However, efforts to improve the catalytic affinity of natural 
enzymes to their preferred substrates have been found more difficult, 
with only a few successful examples [41,42]. 
Compared to directed evolution, computed protein design can pro-
vide a clear transformation plan and significantly reduce the workload 
of building and screening mutant libraries. At present, many achieve-
ments have been made in de novo protein design, enzyme-substrate 
selectivity,  and  thermal  stability  design  with  some  engineered  en-
zymes reaching the industrial application level [43]. 

4. Computer-Assisted Design (CAD) 

With the exponential increase of computing power and the advance 
of protein design algorithms, computer-assisted design has become an 
indispensable tool to model protein structures to tailor to specific bio-
catalysts.  Computer-Assisted  Design  (CAD)  generally  focuses  on  the 
movement  of  the  overall  protein  structure  in  different  situations. 
Through the use of fundamental theories of chemistry, physics, and 
statistics, the changes of energy and interaction between each amino 
acid in the movement is revealed, as well as the “lock and key” [26] 
mode formed by the process of substrate entering the binding pocket. 
With CAD approach, researchers design and predict the changes of free 
energy of engineering proteins and bind the substrate and coenzyme 
using  methods  of  simulated  annealing,  three-dimensional  structure 
searching methods, and quantum mechanical calculation methods rep-
resented by Monte Carlo approaches [27]. The engineered protein is 
thus expressed and analyzed for verification of the design results and 
finally the target enzyme is tailored to meet the unique needs. A classic 
example is the development of antibodies against novel coronavirus 
(COVID-19).  In 2020,  the  novel coronavirus  has  spread  rapidly and 
seriously threatened human health all over the world. To effectively 
combat the novel coronavirus, it is of great importance to analyze the 
protein structure of novel coronavirus and to develop effective inhibitors 
for health and medical research sectors. Rao and Jiang firstly identified 
the  high-resolution  crystal  structure  of  key  hydrolase  Mpro  of 
COVID-19.  Furthermore,  they  used  computer-assisted  technology  to 

5. Machine learning design protein 

Data-driven protein design methods based on computational ma-
chine learning (ML), in particular deep learning, have been applied to 
protein structure design with the accumulation of interaction informa-
tion relating to protein structure and functionality. Recently, Harvard 
University’s G. Church established the UniRep neural network. UniRep 
can extract the basic characteristics of protein structures directly from 
amino acid sequences through deep learning, and accurately predict the 
impact of amino acid replacement on protein function, saving a signif-
icant amount of work, material, and financial resources. Based on the 
model  of  Victoria  jellyfish  green  fluorescent  protein  (GFP),  64,800 
variants of the protein were analyzed by UniRep, each with 1–12 mu-
tations. The results show that UniRep can accurately predict how the 
mutation will change the protein’s brightness [44]. 
ML also showed powerful application in the field of protein engi-
neering,  predicting  a  beneficial  mutant  that  can  improve  enzyme

activity and persistent stability, which was successfully verified [45]. 
Arnold used GB1 protein binding data to build a model and obtained an 
optimal mutant through the use of machine learning. Subsequently, the 
method  was  applied  to the  directed evolution of  enzyme enantiose-
lectivity. The phenyl-dimethyl silane reaction with 2-diazopropanoic 
acid ethyl ester (Me EDA) was catalyzed by Rma NOD enzyme. It suc-
cessfully predicted and verified that a mutant enzyme capable of pro-
ducing only S or R enantiomers was obtained. The ee values of the two 
products were 93% and 79%, respectively [46]. With the development 
of advanced computer technologies, low-cost data-driven protein design 
will  gradually  replace  protein  engineering  and  resolve  the  current 
defects.

6. Introduction of unnatural amino acids in protein engineering 
With a deeper understanding of active unnatural amino acids, a new 
enzyme design strategy introducing unnatural amino acids as the cata-
lytic amino acid residue has begun to be applied in site-directed muta-
genesis for enzyme redesign [47–49]. The enzyme redesigned by this 
new strategy imitates the natural enzyme and promotes the target re-
action [50,51]. Clemens Mayer et al. introduced the unnatural amino 
acid PAF (p-Aminophenylalanine) at the 15th position of the resistance 
regulatory factor of Lactococcus lactis (LmrR) which is called LmrR-PAF. 
The variant LmrR_PAF_RMH (containing the A92R/N19M/F93H muta-
tion) was then obtained through multiple rounds of mutation of the 
residue binding to the substrate pocket. The Kcat of LmrR_ PAF_RMH was 
found to be 91-fold over the wild type [52]. 
Of course, enzyme’s stability is critical to influence its industrial 
application [53], as a highly stable enzyme can accept more extensive 
mutations while retaining its natural structure thus showing great po-
tential for directed evolution [54]. High enzyme stability is the syner-
gistic  result  of  non-covalent  interactions,  covalent  interactions,  salt 
bridges,  aromatic  interactions,  and  hydrophobic  interactions  [55]. 
Homoserine  o-succinyl-transferase  (MetA)  is  an  important  protein 
related  to  methionine  synthesis.  The  instability  of  MetA  causes  the 
growth  of  Escherichia  coli  to  be  hindered  above  40 ℃.  Jack  C.L

introduced  a  pisothiocyanate  phenylalanine  (pNCSF)  containing  iso-
thiocyanate group at the interface of MetA dimer, which can establish a 
thiourea connection between residues at high temperatures. Through 
temperature and pressure screening, the author screened F264pNCSF 
mutants, which kept aspects of the catalytic activity of wild-type en-
zymes  whilst  resulting  in  a  significant  increase  in  melting  point 
compared with the wild-type enzyme. Meanwhile, the connection be-
tween the unnatural amino acids and proline at the second position in 
the dimer was established by mass spectrometry [56].

Acknowledgments 

With the development of biotechnology, a technical term coined 
‘artificial synthetase’ began to emerge. As the "energy factory" of cells, 
mitochondria are indispensable and important organs. The mitochon-
dria dysfunction caused by electron accumulation due to the interrup-
tion of the electron transfer chain (ETC), can lead to more than 300 rare 
genetic  diseases,  such  as  Leigh  syndrome  (a  serious  nervous  system 
disease that may occur in early infancy) and MELAS (which can lead to 
muscle weakness, diabetes and strokes, usually before the age of 40). 
Excess electrons eventually spill into the blood circulatory system in the 
form of lactate, which can be used as a marker of intracellular diseases. 
Patgiri A et al. [57] created an artificial enzyme (known as LOXCAT) to 
alleviate intracellular redox imbalance by directly cycling redox me-
tabolites.  The  new  synthetase  was  constructed  base  on  the  crystal 
structure of two kinds of lactate oxidase (LOX) and catalase (CAT) [58, 
59], which derived from bacterial proteins and the biochemical data 
[60,61]. They added LOXCAT to a human cell culture medium with 
mitochondrial  defects  and  found  that  the  artificial  enzyme  LOXCAT 
converts lactate into pyruvate, which enters the cell and absorbs elec-
trons, thereby reducing the build-up. Pyruvate is then converted into 
lactic acid, which is released from cells. LOXCAT converts this lactic acid 
into pyruvate again, thus forming a cycle. This emergency of artificial 
enzyme will provide a new dawn for the clinical treatment of some 
mitochondrial dysfunction diseases. 
8. Summary and prospects 

Apparently, green and environmentally sustainable renewable en-
ergy  technologies  were  developed  to  replace  traditional  industrial 
catalysis. Of course, green enzyme catalysis technology is a primary 
choice of green technology. However, due to limitations of the existing 
scientific and technological conditions and environment, there are still 
many unexplored enzymes that have not been implemented. That is, the 
functions of existing enzymes cannot currently meet the needs of mod-
ern industrial catalysis. Therefore, engineering enzyme transformations 
has become an essential means for us to obtain specific enzyme func-
tions. This review introduced the successful transformation of natural 
enzymes within protein engineering and the application of data-driven 
artificial  intelligence  to  practice  in  life  science.  With  AI  technology 
development, our vision has gradually changed from the known protein 
sequence-structure information. It is a significant leap in life sciences to 
reconstruct  the  unknown  protein  sequence-structure  information 
through engineering. At present, the application of artificial intelligence 
in life science is at an early development stage. It is expected that pro-
teins based on AI technology will be able to meet future industrial needs 
and resolve current technical bottlenecks in industrial circle. With the 
advancement of science and technology, the intersection of these dis-
ciplines will inevitably bring us more protein engineering technologies 
and provide us a clearer understanding of the structure and function of 
enzymes.  The  application  of  artificial  intelligence  in  the  process  of 
enzyme transformation is the best example. The enzyme function could 
be significantly manipulated according to our needs by using continuous 
development of novel protein engineering technologies, conforming to 
the trend of green catalysis.
