Protein structures can provide invaluable information, both for reasoning about 
biological processes and for enabling interventions such as structure-based drug 
development or targeted mutagenesis. After decades of effort, 17% of the total 
residues in human protein sequences are covered by an experimentally-determined 
structure1. Here we dramatically expand structural coverage by applying the 
state-of-the-art machine learning method, AlphaFold2, at scale to almost the entire 
human proteome (98.5% of human proteins). The resulting dataset covers 58% of 
residues with a confident prediction, of which a subset (36% of all residues) have very 
high confidence. We introduce several metrics developed by building on the 
AlphaFold model, and use them to interpret the dataset, identifying strong 
multi-domain predictions as well as regions likely to be disordered. Finally, we provide 
some case studies illustrating how high-quality predictions may be used to generate 
biological hypotheses. Importantly, we are making our predictions freely available to 
the community via a public database (hosted by the European Bioinformatics 
Institute at https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/). We anticipate that routine large-scale and 
high-accuracy structure prediction will become an important tool, allowing new 
questions to be addressed from a structural perspective.

ACCELERATED ARTICLE PREVIEW 

The monumental success of the human genome project revealed new 
worlds of protein coding genes, and many researchers set out to map 
these proteins to their structures3,4. Thanks to the efforts of individual 
labs and dedicated structural genomics initiatives, over 50,000 human 
protein structures have now been deposited, making Homo sapiens 
by far the best represented species in the Protein Data Bank (PDB)5. 
Despite this intensive study, only 35% of human proteins map to a PDB 
entry, and in many cases the structure covers just a fragment of the 
sequence6. Experimental structure determination requires overcom-
ing many time-consuming hurdles: the protein must be produced 
in sufficient quantities, purified, appropriate sample preparation 
conditions chosen, and high-quality datasets collected. A target may 
prove intractable at any stage, and depending on the chosen method, 
properties like protein size, the presence of transmembrane regions, 
presence of disorder, or susceptibility to conformational change can 
be a hindrance7,8. As such, full structural coverage of the proteome 
remains an outstanding challenge.

Structure prediction has seen substantial progress in recent years, 
as evidenced by the results of the biennial Critical Assessment of pro-
tein Structure Prediction (CASP)29,30. In particular, the latest version of 
AlphaFold was entered in CASP14 under the team name “AlphaFold2”. 
This system used a completely different model from our CASP13 entry31, 
and demonstrated a considerable improvement over previous meth-
ods in terms of providing routinely high accuracy29,30. Backbone pre-
dictions with sub-Ångström Root Mean Square Distance (RMSD-Cα) 
are now common, and side chains are increasingly accurate2. Good 
results can often be achieved even for challenging proteins without a 
template structure in the PDB, or with relatively few related sequences 

whole proteomes15, and in some cases full chains or complexes16,17. In 
particular, projects like SWISS-MODEL Repository, Genome3D, and 
ModBase have made valuable contributions by providing access to 
large numbers of structures and encouraging their free use by the 
community17–19. Related protein bioinformatics fields have developed 
alongside structure prediction, including protein design20,21, function 
annotation22–24, disorder prediction25, and domain identification and 
classification26–28. While some of our analyses are inspired by this prior 
work, here we focus mainly on structural investigations for which scale 
and accuracy are particularly enabling.

Protein structure prediction contributes to closing this gap by 
providing actionable structural hypotheses quickly and at scale. 
Prior large-scale structure prediction work has addressed protein 
families9–12, specific functional classes13,14, domains identified within

Articleto build a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)2. These improvements 
are significant because more accurate models permit a wider range of 
applications: not only homology search and putative function assign-
ment, but also molecular replacement and druggable pocket detection, 
for instance32–34. In light of this we applied the current state-of-the-art 
method, AlphaFold, to the human proteome.

Here we process full-length protein chains. There are several motiva-
tions. Restricting the prediction to pre-identified domains risks missing 
structured regions that have yet to be annotated. It also discards contex-
tual information from the rest of the sequence, which might be useful 
where two or more domains interact substantially. Finally, the full-chain 
approach lets the model attempt an interdomain packing prediction.
Interdomain accuracy was assessed at CASP14, and AlphaFold out-
performed other methods41. However, the assessment was based on a 
small target set. To further evaluate AlphaFold on long multi-domain 
proteins, we compiled a test set of recent PDB chains not in the model’s 
training set. Only chains with > 800 resolved residues were included, 
and a template filter was applied (see Methods). Performance on this 
set was evaluated using the Template Modelling score (TM-score42), 
which should better reflect global as opposed to per-domain accu-
racy. The results were encouraging, with 70% of predictions having a 
TM-score > 0.7 (Fig. 2a).

Model confidence and added coverage
We predicted structures for the UniProt human reference proteome 
(one representative sequence per gene), with an upper length limit of 
2700 residues6. The final dataset covers 98.5% of human proteins with 
a full-chain prediction.

We consider a prediction highly accurate when, in addition to a good 
backbone prediction, the side chains are frequently correctly oriented. 
On this basis, pLDDT > 90 is taken as the high accuracy cutoff, above 
which AlphaFold Chi-1 rotamers are 80% correct on a recent PDB test 
set (Extended Data Fig. 3). A lower cutoff of pLDDT > 70 corresponds 
to a generally correct backbone prediction (Extended Data Table 2). 
AlphaFold’s accuracy on an example protein within a number of pLDDT 
bands is illustrated in Fig. 1b.

For the resulting predictions to be practically useful, they must come 
with a well-calibrated and sequence-resolved confidence measure. The 
latter point is particularly important when predicting full chains, as we 
expect to see high confidence on domains but low confidence on linkers 
and unstructured regions (see Extended Data Fig. 1 for examples). To 
this end, AlphaFold produces a per-residue confidence metric called 
predicted lDDT-Cα (pLDDT) on a scale from 0 to 100. pLDDT estimates 
how well the prediction would agree with an experimental structure 
based on the Local Distance Difference Test35. It has been shown to be 
well-calibrated (Fig. 1a; see also Extended Data Fig. 2, Extended Data 
Table 1) and full details on how pLDDT is produced are given in the 
Supplementary Information (SI) of the AlphaFold paper2.

The AlphaFold paper SI describes how a variety of useful predictors 
can be built on top of the main model. In particular, we can predict the 
residues likely to be experimentally resolved, and use them to pro-
duce a predicted TM-score (pTM), where each residue’s contribution is 
weighted by the probability of it being resolved (Suppl. Methods 1). The 
motivation for the weighting is to downweight unstructured parts of 
the prediction, producing a metric that better reflects the model’s con-
fidence about the packing of the structured domains that are present. 
On the same recent PDB test set, pTM correlates well with the actual 
TM-score (Pearson’s r = 0.84, Fig. 2b). Interestingly, while some outli-
ers on this plot are genuine failure cases, others appear to be plausible 
alternate conformations (Fig. 2b; 6OFS_A43).

ACCELERATED ARTICLE PREVIEW 

We computed pTM scores for the human proteome, in an effort to 
identify multi-domain predictions that might feature novel domain 
packings. The criteria applied were a pLDDT > 70 on at least 600 resi-
dues constituting over half the sequence, with no template hit covering 
over half the sequence. The distribution of pTM scores after applying 
the above filters is shown in Fig. 2c. Note that we would not expect 
uniformly high TM scores to be achievable on this set, since some pro-
teins will contain domains mobile relative to each other, with no fixed 
packing. Of the set, 187 proteins have pTM > 0.8 and 343 have pTM > 
0.7. While we expect AlphaFold’s interdomain accuracy to be lower than 
its within-domain accuracy, this set should nonetheless be enriched 
for interesting multi-domain predictions, suggesting that the dataset 
provides on the order of hundreds of these. Four examples, the predic-
tions with the highest number of confident residues subject to pTM > 
0.8, are shown in Fig. 2d.

Glucose-6-phosphatase
G6Pase-α (UniProt P35575) is a membrane-bound enzyme that catalyzes 
the final step in glucose synthesis; it is therefore of critical importance 
to maintaining blood sugar levels. No experimental structure exists, 
but previous studies have attempted to characterize the transmem-
brane topology44 and active site45. Our prediction has very high con-
fidence (median pLDDT 95.5) and gives a nine-helix topology with 
the putative active site accessible via an entry tunnel roughly in line 
with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) surface (Fig. 3a, Suppl. Video 1). 
Positively-charged residues in our prediction (median pLDDT 96.6) 
align closely with the previously identified active site homologue in 
a fungal vanadium chloroperoxidase (PDB 1IDQ; RMSD 0.56 Å, 49/51 
aligned atoms)46. Since these enzymes have distinct functions, we 

ACCELERATED ARTICLE PREVIEW 

We note that AlphaFold’s accuracy was validated in CASP142, which 
focuses on challenging proteins dissimilar to the structures already 
in the PDB. By contrast, many human proteins have templates with 
high sequence identity. To evaluate AlphaFold’s applicability in this 
regime, we predicted structures for one year of targets from the Con-
tinuous Automated Model Evaluation (CAMEO) benchmark39,40, a 
structure-prediction assessment that measures a wider range of diffi-
culties. We find that AlphaFold adds substantial accuracy over CAMEO’s 
BestSingleStructuralTemplate baseline across a wide range of levels of 
template identity (Extended Data Fig. 4).

On the human proteome, 35.7% of total residues fall within the high-
est accuracy band (corresponding to 38.6% of residues for which a 
prediction was produced; Fig. 1c). This is double the number of residues 
covered by an experimental structure. 58.0% of total residues are pre-
dicted confidently (pLDDT > 70), implying that we also add substantial 
coverage for sequences without a good template in PDB (sequence 
identity below 30%). At the per-protein level, 43.8% of proteins have 
a confident prediction on at least three quarters of their sequence, 
while 1,290 proteins contain a substantial region (over 200 residues) 
with pLDDT ≥ 70 and no good template.

The dataset adds high-quality structural models across a broad range 
of Gene Ontology (GO) terms36,37, including pharmaceutically-relevant 
classes such as enzymes and membrane proteins38 (Fig. 1d). Membrane 
proteins in particular are generally underrepresented in the PDB 
because they have historically been challenging experimental targets. 
This shows that AlphaFold is able to produce confident predictions 
even for protein classes that are not abundant wthin its training set.

Highlighted predictions
We next discuss some case study predictions and the insights they may 
provide. All predictions presented are de novo, lacking any template 
with 25% sequence identity or more covering 20% of the sequence. Our 
discussion concerns biological hypotheses, which would ultimately 
need to be confirmed by experimental studies.

Full chain prediction
Many previous large-scale structure prediction efforts have focused 
on domains—regions of the sequence that fold independently9–11,15.

Articleprobed our prediction for clues about substrate specificity. In the 
G6Pase-α binding pocket face, opposite the residues shared with the 
chloroperoxidase, we predict a conserved glutamate (Glu110) that is 
also present in our G6Pase-β prediction (Glu105) but not the chlorop-
eroxidase (Fig. 3a). The glutamate could stabilize the binding pocket 
in a closed conformation, forming salt bridges with positively charged 
residues there. It is also the most solvent-exposed residue of the puta-
tive active site, suggesting a possible gating function. To our knowledge 
this residue has not been discussed previously and illustrates the novel 
mechanistic hypotheses that can be obtained from high quality struc-
ture predictions.

(Fig. 4a). To investigate this connection, we evaluated pLDDT as a dis-
order predictor on the Critical Assessment of protein Intrinsic Disorder 
prediction (CAID) benchmark set25. The results showed pLDDT to be 
a competitive disorder predictor compared to the current state of 
the art (SPOT-Disorder263), with an AUC of 0.897 (Fig. 4b). Moreover, 
the AlphaFold paper SI describes an “experimentally resolved head”, 
which is specifically trained for the task of predicting whether a resi-
due will be resolved in an experimental structure. The experimentally 
resolved head performed even better on the CAID benchmark, with 
an AUC of 0.921.

These disorder-prediction results suggest that a significant per-
centage of low-confidence residues may be explained by some form 
of disorder, but we caution that this could encompass both regions 
that are intrinsically disordered and regions that are structured only 
in complex. A potential example of the latter scenario drawn from 
recent PDB is shown in Fig. 4c; chain C interacts extensively with the 
rest of the complex, such that the interface region would be unlikely 
to adopt the same structure outside of this context. In a systematic 
analysis of recent PDB chains, we observed that AlphaFold has much 
lower accuracy for regions where the chain has a high percentage of 
heterotypic, cross-chain contacts (see Fig. 4d).

Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2
Triacylglycerol synthesis is responsible for storing excess metabolic energy 
as fat in adipose tissue. DGAT2 (UniProt Q96PD7) is one of two essential 
acyltransferases catalyzing the final acyl addition in this pathway, and 
inhibiting DGAT2 has been shown to improve liver function in mouse mod-
els of liver disease47. With our highly confident predicted structure (median 
pLDDT 95.9), we set out to identify the binding pocket for a known inhibi-
tor, PF-06424439 (ref. 48). We identified a pocket (median pLDDT 93.7) in 
which we were able to dock the inhibitor and observe specific interactions 
(Fig. 3b) that were not recapitulated in a negative example49 (Suppl. Meth-
ods 2, Extended Data Fig. 5). DGAT2 has an evolutionarily-divergent but 
biochemically similar analog, diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1)50. 
Within DGAT2’s binding pocket, we identified residues (Glu243, His163; 
Fig. 3b) analogous to the proposed catalytic residues in DGAT1 (His415, 
Glu416)51, although we note that the nearby Ser244 in DGAT2 may present 
an alternative mechanism via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. Previous 
experimental work with DGAT2 has shown that mutating His163 has a 
stronger deleterious effect than mutating a histidine two residues away52. 
Additionally, Glu243 and His163 are conserved across species50, support-
ing this hypothesized catalytic geometry.

Wolframin
Wolframin (UniProt O76024) is a transmembrane protein localized 
to the ER. Mutations in the WFS1 gene are associated with Wolfram 
syndrome 1, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by early-onset 
diabetes, gradual visual and hearing loss, and early death53,54. Given the 
lower confidence in our full prediction (median pLDDT 81.7, Fig. 3c), we 
proposed identifying regions unique to this structure. A recent evolu-
tionary analysis suggested domains for wolframin, which our prediction 
largely supports55. An interesting distinction is the incorporation of a 
cysteine-rich domain (Fig. 3c, yellow) to the oligonucleotide binding 
(OB) fold (Fig. 3c, green and yellow) as the characteristic β1 strand56. 
The cysteine-rich region then forms an extended L12 loop with two 
predicted disulfide bridges, before looping back to the prototypical 
β2 strand. Comparing our prediction for this region (median pLDDT 
86.0) against existing PDB chains using TM-align42,57 identified 3F1Z58 
as the most similar known chain (TM-score 0.472; Fig. 3c, magenta). 
Despite being the most similar chain, 3F1Z lacks the cysteines present 
in wolframin, which could form disulfide cross-links in the ER59. As this 
region is hypothesized to recruit other proteins55, these structural 
insights are likely important to understanding its partners.

Finally, we note that the importance of the human proteome for 
health and medicine has led to it being intensively studied from a struc-
tural perspective. Other organisms are much less well represented 
in the PDB, including biologically significant, medically relevant, or 
economically important species. Structure prediction may have a more 
profound impact on the study of these organisms, for which fewer 
experimental structures are available. Looking beyond the proteome 
scale, the UniProt database contains hundreds of millions of proteins 
that have so far been addressed mainly by sequence-based methods, 
and for which the easy availability of structures might open up entirely 
new avenues of investigation. By providing scalable structure predic-
tion with hitherto unprecedented accuracy, AlphaFold could enable 

Discussion
In this work we generated comprehensive, state-of-the-art struc-
ture predictions for the human proteome. The resulting dataset 
makes a large contribution to structural coverage of the proteome; 
particularly for tasks where high accuracy is advantageous like 
molecular replacement or the characterisation of binding sites. 
We have also applied several metrics produced by building on 
the AlphaFold architecture - pLDDT, pTM, and the experimentally 
resolved head - demonstrating how they can be used to interpret 
our predictions.

The parts of the human proteome still without a confident prediction 
represent directions for future research. Some proportion of these 
will be genuine failures, where a fixed structure exists but the current 
version of AlphaFold does not predict it. In many other cases, where 
the sequence is unstructured in isolation, the problem arguably falls 
outside the scope of single-chain structure prediction. It will be crucial 
to develop new methods that can address the biology of these regions, 
for example, by predicting the structure in complex or by predicting a 
distribution over possible states in the cellular milieu.

Regions without a confident prediction
Since we are applying AlphaFold to the entire human proteome, we 
would expect a significant percentage of residues to be contained in 
regions that are always or sometimes disordered in solution. Disorder 
is common in the proteomes of eukaryotes60,61, and one prior work62 
estimates the percentage of disordered residues in the human pro-
teome at 37-50%. Thus disorder will play a large role when we consider 
a comprehensive set of predictions covering an entire proteome.

In summary, our current interpretation of regions where AlphaFold 
exhibits low pLDDT is that they have significant likelihood of being 
unstructured in isolation. In the current dataset, long regions with 
pLDDT < 50 adopt a readily identifiable ribbon-like appearance, and 
should not be interpreted as structures but rather as a prediction of 
disorder.

While we have presented several case studies to illustrate the type of 
insights that may be gained from these data, we recognize that there 
is still much more to uncover. By making our predictions available to 
the community we hope to enable exploration of new directions in 
structural bioinformatics.

Furthermore, we observed a large difference in the pLDDT distri-
bution between resolved and unresolved residues in PDB sequences

days. This estimate is based on taking a sample of 240 human proteins 
stratified by length, timing each stage when run with empty caches, 
fitting a quadratic relationship between sequence length and run 
time, then applying that relationship to the sequences in the human 
proteome. Extended Data Fig. 7 presents the data used to make this 
estimate.

In the section on full-chain prediction, template filtering is based on 
the highest sequence identity of any single Hmmsearch hit with > 50% 
coverage. This is because high coverage templates are particularly rel-
evant when considering whether a predicted domain packing is novel.

Template coverage
Except where otherwise noted, template coverage was estimated on a 
per-residue basis as follows. Hmmsearch was run against a copy of the 
PDB SEQRES (downloaded 15/02/2021) using default flags67. The prior 
template coverage at residue i is the max % sequence identity of all hits 
covering residue i, regardless of whether the hit residue is experimen-
tally resolved. For recent PDB analysis, only template hits correspond-
ing to a structure released before 30/04/2018 were accepted.

GO term breakdown
GO annotations were taken from the XML metadata for the UniProt 
human reference proteome and were matched to the Gene Ontol-
ogy in obo format36,37. One erroneous is_a relationship was manually 
removed (GO:0071702 is_a GO:0006820, see changelog https://www.
ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/GO:0071702). The ontology file was used 
to propagate the GO annotations using is_a and part_of relations to 
assign parent-child relationships, and accounting for alternative IDs.
GO terms were then filtered to a manageable number for display, first 
by filtering for terms with > 3000 annotations, and from those select-
ing only moderately specific terms (a term cannot have a child with > 
3000 annotations). The remaining terms in the Molecular Function 
and Cellular Component ontologies are displayed in Fig. 1d.

Structure prediction (human proteome)
Sequences for the human reference proteome were obtained from 
UniProt release 2021_026. Structure prediction was attempted for all 
sequences with 16–2700 amino acids, and sequences with residue 
codes B, J, O, U, Z or X are also excluded. The length ceiling of 2700 
residues does not represent an absolute limit for the method, but was 
chosen to keep run times manageable. The structure prediction process 
was largely as described in the AlphaFold paper2, consisting of five 
steps: MSA construction, template search, inference with five models, 
model-ranking based on mean pLDDT, and constrained relaxation of 
the predicted structures. The following differences were introduced for 
the proteome-scale pipeline. First, the search against the metagenom-
ics database Big Fantastic Database (BFD) was replaced with a search 
against “Reduced BFD” using Jackhmmer from HMMER367,68. Reduced 
BFD consists of a multiline FASTA containing the first non-consensus 
sequence from each BFD a3m. Second, the amount of ensembling was 
reduced by a factor of eight. At least four relaxed full-chain models 
were successfully produced for 20,296 sequences out of 20,614 FASTA 
entries, covering 98.5% of proteins. Sequences > 2700 residues account 
for the majority of exclusions. This amounts to 10,537,122 residues 
(92.5% of residues).

Structure prediction (recent PDB set)
For structure prediction on recent PDB sequences, we used a copy of 
the PDB downloaded 15/02/2021. Structures were filtered to those 
with a release date after 30/04/2018 (the date limit for inclusion in 
AlphaFold’s training set). Chains were then further filtered to remove 
sequences consisting of a single amino acid, sequences with an ambigu-
ous chemical component at any residue position, and sequences with-
out a PDB 40% sequence clustering. Exact duplicates were removed 
by choosing the chain with the most resolved Cα atoms as the rep-
resentative sequence. Then, structures with < 16 resolved residues, 
with unknown residues, and structures solved by nuclear magnetic 
resonance methods (NMR) were filtered out. Structure prediction then 
followed the same procedure as for the human proteome with the same 
length and residue limits, except that templates with a release date 
after 30/04/2018 were disallowed. Finally the dataset was redundancy 
reduced, by taking the chain with the best non-zero resolution from 
each cluster in the PDB 40% sequence clustering giving a dataset of 
12,494 chains. This is referred to as the recent PDB set.

For  docking  against  DGAT2,  P2Rank65  was  used  to  identify 
ligand-binding pockets in the AlphaFold structure. AutoDockTools70 
was used to convert the AlphaFold prediction to PDBQT format. For 
the ligands, DGAT2-specific inhibitor (CAS Number: 1469284-79-4) 
and DGAT1-specific inhibitor (CAS Number: 942999-61-3) were also 
prepared in PDBQT format using AutoDockTools. AutoDock Vina71 was 
run with an exhaustiveness parameter of 32, a seed of 0, and a docking 
search space of 25 × 25 × 25 Å3 centred at the point identified by P2Rank.
For identifying the most similar structure to wolframin, TM-align42 
was used to compare against all PDB chains (downloaded 15/02/2021) 
with our prediction as the reference. This returned 3F1Z with a TM-score 
of 0.472.

Compute resources
Inference was run on V100 graphics processing units (GPUs), with each 
sequence inferenced five times to produce five inputs to model selec-
tion. To prevent out of memory errors, long sequences were assigned 
to multi-GPU workers. Specifically, sequences of length 1401-2000 
residues were processed by workers with two GPUs, and those of length 
2001-2700 residues by workers with four GPUs (see companion paper 
for details of unified memory on longer proteins; it is possible higher 
memory workers could be used without additional GPUs).

The total resources used for inference were logged and amounted to 
930 GPU days. This accounts for generating five models per protein; 
~190 GPU days would be sufficient to inference each protein once. Long 
sequences had a disproportionate impact due to the multi-GPU work-
ers described above. Approximately 250 GPU days would have been 
sufficient to produce five models for all proteins shorter than 1400 
residues. For reference, Extended Data Fig. 6 shows the relationship 
between sequence length and inference time.

Analysis of low-confidence regions
For evaluation on CAID, the target sequences and ground truth 
labels for the Disprot-PDB set were downloaded from idpcentral.
org. Structure prediction was performed as described above for 
recent PDB, with a template cutoff of 30/04/2018. To enable complete 
coverage, two sequences containing non-standard residues (X, U)  
had these remapped to G, glycine. Sequences longer than 2000  
residues were split into two segments: 1-2000 and 2000-end, and the 

Additional metrics
The implementation of pTM is described in the AlphaFold paper SI 
section 1.9.7, and the implementation of the experimentally resolved 
head is described in section 1.9.10. The weighted version of pTM is 
described in Suppl. Methods 1.

All other stages of the pipeline (MSA search, template search and 
constrained relaxation) ran on the central processing unit (CPU) and 
used standard tools. Our human proteome run made use of some 
cached intermediates (e.g. stored MSA search results). However, we 
estimate the total cost of running these stages from scratch at 510 core 

Structure analysis
Structure images were created in PyMOL69, and PyMOL align was used 
to compute RMSDs (outlier rejection is described in the text where 
applicable).

pLDDT and experimentally-resolved head arrays were concatenated 
for evaluation. The two evaluated disorder predictors were taken 
to be 1 - 0.01 * pLDDT and 1 - predicted resolvability for Cα atoms, 
respectively.

To obtain the ratio of heterotypic contacts to all contacts (Fig. 4d), 
two residues are considered in contact if their Cβ atoms (or Cα for 
glycine) are within 8 Å29 and if they are separated in primary sequence 
by at least three other residues (to exclude contacts within an α-helix). 
Heteromers are identified as protein entities with a different entity_id 
in the structure mmCIF file.

BestSingleStructuralTemplate comparison
CAMEO data for the period 21/03/2020 to 13/03/2021 was downloaded 
from the CAMEO website. AlphaFold predictions were produced for all 
sequences in the target.fasta files, using the same procedure detailed 
above but with a max template date of 01/03/2020. Predictions were 
scored against the CAMEO ground truth using lDDT-Cα. For BestSin-
gleStructuralTemplate lDDT-Cα scores were taken from the CAMEO 
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files provided. Structures solved 
by solution NMR and solid-state NMR were filtered out at the analy-
sis stage. To determine the template identity, templates were drawn 
from a copy of PDB downloaded on 15/02/2021 with template search 
performed using Hmmsearch. Templates were filtered to those with 
at least 70% coverage of the sequence and a release date prior to the 
query. The template with the highest e-value after filtering was used 
to compute the template identity. Targets were binned according to 
template identity, with width 10 bins ranging from 30 to 90. Extended 
Data Fig. 4 shows the distribution of lDDT-Cα for each model within 
each bin as a boxplot (horizontal line at the median, box spanning from 
the lower to the upper quartile, whiskers extending to the minimum 
and maximum. Four hundred and twenty-eight targets were included 
in the analysis.

structures with a reported resolution < 3.5 Å (N = 2,756,569 residues). Residues 
were assigned to bins of width 10 based on their pLDDT (min 20, max 100). 

Markers show the mean lDDT-Cα within each bin, while the lDDT-Cα 
distribution is visualized as a Matplotlib violin plot (kernel density estimate 
bandwidth 0.2). Smallest sample size for the corresponding violin is 5,655 
residues for the left-most bin.

Markers show the proportion of correct Chi-1 angles within each bin, while 
error bars indicate the 95% confidence interval (Student’s t, two-sided). 
Smallest sample size for the error bars is 193 residues for the left-most bin.

Data collection

Source code for the AlphaFold model, trained weights, and an inference script are available under an open-source license at https://
github.com/deepmind/alphafold. Neural networks were developed with TensorFlow v1 (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), Sonnet 
v1 (https://github.com/deepmind/sonnet), JaX v0.1.69 (https://github.com/google/jax/), and Haiku v0.0.4 (https://github.com/deepmind/dm-
haiku). 
 
For MSA search on UniRef90,  MGnify clusters, and reduced BFD we used jackhmmer and for template search on the PDB seqres we used 
hmmsearch, both from HMMER v3.3 (http://eddylab.org/software/hmmer/). For template search against PDB70, we used HHsearch from HH-
suite v3.0-beta.3 14/07/2017 (https://github.com/soedinglab/hh-suite). For constrained relaxation of structures, we used OpenMM v7.3.1 
(https://github.com/openmm/openmm) with the Amber99sb force field.  
 
Docking analysis on DGAT used P2Rank v2.1 (https://github.com/rdk/p2rank), MGLTools v1.5.6 (https://ccsb.scripps.edu/mgltools/) and 
AutoDockVina v1.1.2 (http://vina.scripps.edu/download/) on a workstation running Debian GNU/Linux rodete 5.10.40-1rodete1-amd64 
x86_64.

Data analysis

Data analysis used Python v3.6 (https://www.python.org/), NumPy v1.16.4 (https://github.com/numpy/numpy), SciPy v1.2.1 (https://
www.scipy.org/), seaborn v0.11.1 (https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn), scikit-learn v0.24.0 (https://github.com/scikit-learn/), Matplotlib 
v3.3.4 (https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib), pandas v1.1.5 (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas), and Colab (https://
research.google.com/colaboratory). TM-align v20190822 (https://zhanglab.dcmb.med.umich.edu/TM-align) was used for computing TM-
scores. Structure analysis used Pymol v2.3.0 (https://github.com/schrodinger/pymol-open-source).

For manuscripts utilizing custom algorithms or software that are central to the research but not yet described in published literature, software must be made available to editors and 
reviewers. We strongly encourage code deposition in a community repository (e.g. GitHub). See the Nature Research guidelines for submitting code & software for further information.

Policy information about availability of data
All manuscripts must include a data availability statement. This statement should provide the following information, where applicable: 

- Accession codes, unique identifiers, or web links for publicly available datasets 
- A list of figures that have associated raw data 
- A description of any restrictions on data availability

AlphaFold structure predictions for the human proteome are available under a CC-BY-4.0 license at https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/. 
 
All input data are freely available from public sources. The human reference proteome together with its xml annotations was obtained from UniProt 2021_02 
(https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/uniprot/previous_releases/release-2021_02/knowledgebase/). 
At prediction time, MSA search was performed against UniRef90 2020_03 (https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/uniprot/previous_releases/release-2020_03/
uniref/), MGnify clusters 2018_12 (https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/metagenomics/peptide_database/2018_12/), and a reduced version of BFD (produced from 
as outlined in the Methods from BFD https://bfd.mmseqs.com/). Template structures, the SEQRES fasta file, and the 40% sequence clustering were taken from a 
copy of the PDB downloaded 15/2/2021 (https://www.wwpdb.org/ftp/pdb-ftp-sites; see also https://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/derived_data/ and https://
cdn.rcsb.org/resources/sequence/clusters/bc-40.out for sequence data). Experimental structures are drawn from the same copy of the PDB; we show structures 
with accessions 6YJ1, 6OFS, 1IDQ, 1PRT, 3F1Z, 7KPX and 6VP0. Template search used PDB70, downloaded 10/02/2021 (http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/data/
hhsuite/databases/hhsuite_dbs/). The CAID dataset was downloaded from (https://idpcentral.org/caid/data/1/reference/disprot-disorder-pdb-atleast.txt). CAMEO 
data was accessed 17/03/2021 from (https://www.cameo3d.org/static/downloads/modeling/1-year/raw_targets-1-year.public.tar.gz). A copy of the current Gene 
Ontology was downloaded 29/04/2021 from (http://current.geneontology.org/ontology/go.obo).
