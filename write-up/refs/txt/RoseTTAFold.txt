DeepMind presented remarkably accurate predictions at the recent CASP14 protein structure prediction 
assessment conference. We explored network architectures incorporating related ideas and obtained the 
best performance with a three-track network in which information at the 1D sequence level, the 2D distance 
map level, and the 3D coordinate level is successively transformed and integrated. The three-track network 
produces structure predictions with accuracies approaching those of DeepMind in CASP14, enables the 
rapid solution of challenging X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM structure modeling problems, and provides 
insights into the functions of proteins of currently unknown structure. The network also enables rapid 
generation of accurate protein-protein complex models from sequence information alone, short circuiting 
traditional approaches which require modeling of individual subunits followed by docking. We make the 
method available to the scientific community to speed biological research. 

The prediction of protein structure from amino acid sequence 
information alone has been a longstanding challenge. The bi-
annual  Critical  Assessment  of  Structure  (CASP)  meetings 
have demonstrated that deep learning methods such as Al-
phaFold  (1,  2)  and  trRosetta  (3),  that  extract  information 
from the large database of known protein structures in the 
PDB, outperform more traditional approaches that explicitly 
model the folding process. The outstanding performance of 
DeepMind’s  AlphaFold2  in  the  recent  CASP14  meeting 
(https://predictioncenter.org/casp14/zscores_final.cgi) 
left 
the  scientific  community  eager  to  learn  details  beyond  the 
overall  framework  presented  and  raised  the  question  of 
whether such accuracy could be achieved outside of a world-
leading deep learning company. As described at the CASP14 
conference, 
the  AlphaFold2  methodological  advances 

included  1)  starting  from  multiple  sequence  alignments 
(MSAs) rather than from more processed features such as in-
verse covariance matrices derived from MSAs, 2) replacement 
of 2D convolution with an attention mechanism that better 
represents  interactions  between  residues  distant  along  the 
sequence, 3) use of a two-track network architecture in which 
information at the 1D sequence level and the 2D distance map 
level is iteratively transformed and passed back and forth, 4) 
use of an SE(3)-equivariant Transformer network to directly 
refine atomic coordinates (rather than 2D distance maps as 
in  previous  approaches)  generated  from  the  two-track  net-
work,  and  5)  end-to-end  learning  in  which  all  network  pa-
rameters  are  optimized  by  backpropagation  from  the  final 
generated 3D coordinates through all network layers back to 
the input sequence.

Network architecture development 
Intrigued by the DeepMind results, and with the goal of in-
creasing protein structure prediction accuracy for structural 
biology  research  and  advancing  protein  design  (4),  we  ex-
plored network architectures incorporating different combi-
nations of these five properties. In the absence of a published 
method, we experimented with a wide variety of approaches 
for  passing  information  between  different  parts  of  the  net-
works, as summarized in the methods and table S1. We suc-
ceeded in producing a “two-track” network with information 
flowing in parallel along a 1D sequence alignment track and a 
2D distance matrix track with considerably better performance 
than trRosetta (BAKER-ROSETTASERVER and BAKER in Fig. 
1B),  the  next  best  method  after  AlphaFold2  in  CASP14 
(https://predictioncenter.org/casp14/zscores_final.cgi). 

We reasoned that better performance could be achieved 
by  extending  to  a  third  track  operating  in  3D  coordinate 
space to provide a tighter connection between sequence, res-
idue-residue distances and orientations, and atomic coordi-
nates. We constructed architectures with the two levels of the 
two-track  model  augmented  with  a  third  parallel  structure 
track operating on 3D backbone coordinates as depicted in 
Fig. 1A (see methods and fig. S1 for details). In this architec-
ture, information flows back and forth between the 1D amino 
acid sequence information, the 2D distance map, and the 3D 
coordinates,  allowing  the  network  to  collectively  reason 
about relationships within and between sequences, distances, 
and coordinates. In contrast, reasoning about 3D atomic co-
ordinates in the two-track AlphaFold2 architecture happens 
after  processing  of  the  1D  and  2D  information  is  complete 
(although end-to-end training does link parameters to some 
extent). Because of computer hardware memory limitations, 
we could not train models on large proteins directly as the 
three-track  models  have  many  millions  of  parameters;  in-
stead, we presented to the network many discontinuous crops 
of  the  input  sequence  consisting  of  two  discontinuous  se-
quence segments spanning a total of 260 residues. To gener-
ate final models, we combined and averaged the 1D features 
and  2D  distance  and  orientation  predictions  produced  for 
each of the crops and then used two approaches to generate 
final 3D structures. In the first, the predicted residue-residue 
distance and orientation distributions are fed into pyRosetta 
(5) to generate all-atom models. In the second, the averaged 
1D and 2D features are fed into a final SE(3)-equivariant layer 
(6),  and  following  end-to-end  training  from  amino  acid  se-
quence to 3D coordinates, backbone coordinates are gener-
ated directly by the network (see methods). We refer to these 
networks, which also generate per residue accuracy predic-
tions, as RoseTTAFold. The first has the advantage of requir-
ing lower memory (for proteins over 400 residues, 8GB rather 
than 24GB) GPUs at inference time and producing full side 
chain  models  but  requires  CPU  time  for  the  pyRosetta 

structure modeling step. 

The three-track models with attention operating at the 1D, 
2D, and 3D levels and information flowing between the three 
levels were the best models we tested (Fig. 1B), clearly out-
performing  the  top  2  server  groups  (Zhang-server  and 
BAKER-ROSETTASERVER),  BAKER  human  group  (ranked 
second among all groups), and our two-track attention mod-
els on CASP14 targets. As in the case of AlphaFold2, the cor-
relation  between  multiple  sequence  alignment  depth  and 
model accuracy is lower for RoseTTAFold than for trRosetta 
and  other  methods  tested  at  CASP14  (fig.  S2).  The  perfor-
mance  of the three-track model on the CASP14 targets was 
still  not as good as  AlphaFold2 (Fig. 1B). This could  reflect 
hardware limitations that limited the size of the models we 
could explore, alternative architectures or loss formulations, 
or more intensive use of the network for inference. DeepMind 
reported using several GPUs for days to make individual pre-
dictions, whereas our predictions are made in a single pass 
through the network in the same manner that would be used 
for  a  server;  following  sequence  and  template  search  
(~1.5 hours), the end-to-end version of RoseTTAFold requires 
~10 min on an RTX2080 GPU to generate backbone coordi-
nates for proteins with less than 400 residues, and the pyRo-
setta  version  requires  5  min  for  network  calculations  on  a 
single RTX2080 GPU and an hour for all-atom structure gen-
eration with  15  CPU cores. Incomplete optimization due to 
computer memory limitations and neglect of side chain in-
formation likely explain the poorer performance of the end-
to-end  version  compared  to  the  pyRosetta  version  (Fig.  1B; 
the latter incorporates side chain information at the all-atom 
relaxation stage); since SE(3)-equivariant layers are used in 
the main body of the three-track model, the added gain from 
the final SE(3) layer is likely less than in the AlphaFold2 case. 
We expect the end-to-end approach to ultimately be at least 
as accurate once the computer hardware limitations are over-
come, and side chains are incorporated. 

The improved performance of the three-track models over 
the two-track model with identical training sets, similar at-
tention-based  architectures  for  the  1D  and  2D  tracks,  and 
similar  operations  in  inference  (prediction)  mode  suggests 
that  simultaneously  reasoning  at  the  multiple  sequence 
alignment, distance map, and three-dimensional coordinate 
representations can more effectively extract sequence-struc-
ture  relationships  than  reasoning  over  only  MSA  and  dis-
tance  map  information.  The  relatively  low  compute  cost 
makes  it  straightforward  to  incorporate  the  methods  in  a 
public server and predict structures for large sets of proteins, 
for example, all human GPCRs, as described below. 

Blind structure prediction tests are needed to assess any 
new protein structure prediction method, but CASP is held 
only once every two years. Fortunately, the Continuous Auto-
mated  Model  Evaluation  (CAMEO)  experiment  (7)  tests

structure prediction servers blindly on protein structures as 
they are submitted to the PDB. RoseTTAFold has been evalu-
ated since May 15th, 2021 on CAMEO; over the 69 medium 
and hard targets released during this time (May 15th, 2021 ~ 
June 19th, 2021), it outperformed all other servers evaluated 
in  the  experiment  including  Robetta  (3),  IntFold6-TS  (8), 
BestSingleTemplate (9), and SWISS-MODEL (10) (Fig. 1C). 

We experimented with approaches for further improving 
accuracy by more intensive use of the network during sam-
pling.  Since  the  network  can  take  as  input  templates  of 
known structures, we experimented with a further coupling 
of 3D structural information and 1D sequence information by 
iteratively feeding the predicted structures back into the net-
work as templates and random subsampling from the multi-
ple  sequence  alignments  to  sample  a  broader  range  of 
models.  These  approaches  generated  ensembles  containing 
higher accuracy models, but the accuracy predictor was not 
able to consistently identify models better than those gener-
ated by the rapid single pass method (fig. S3). Nevertheless, 
we suspect that these approaches can improve model perfor-
mance and are carrying out further investigations along these 
lines. 

In  developing  RoseTTAFold,  we  found  that  combining 
predictions  from  multiple  discontinuous  crops  generated 
more accurate structures than predicting the entire structure 
at once (fig. S4A). We hypothesized that this arises from se-
lecting the most relevant sequences for each region from the 
very  large  number  of  aligned  sequences  often  available  
(fig. S4B). To enable the network to focus on the most rele-
vant sequence information for each region while keeping ac-
cess  to  the  full  multiple  sequence  alignment  in  a  more 
memory  efficient  way,  we  experimented  with  the  Perceiver 
architecture (11), updating smaller seed MSAs (up to 100 se-
quences)  with  extra  sequences  (thousands  of  sequences) 
through cross-attention (fig. S4C). Current RoseTTAFold only 
uses the top 1000 sequences due to memory limitations; with 
this addition, all available sequence information can be used 
(often  over  10,000  sequences).  Initial  results  are  promising 
(fig.  S4D),  but  more  training  will  be  required  for  rigorous 
comparison. 
 
Enabling experimental protein structure determination 
With  the  recent  considerable  progress  in  protein  structure 
prediction, a key question is what accurate protein structure 
models can be used for. We investigated the utility of the Ro-
seTTAFold to facilitate experimental structure determination 
by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy and to 
build models providing biological insights for key proteins of 
currently unknown structures. 

Solution  of  X-ray  structures  by  molecular  replacement 
(MR) often requires quite accurate models. The much higher 
accuracy  of  the  RoseTTAFold  method  than  currently 

available methods prompted us to test whether it could help 
solve previously unsolved challenging MR problems and im-
prove the solution of borderline cases. Four recent crystallo-
graphic datasets (summarized, including resolution limits, in 
table  S2),  which  had  eluded  solution  by  MR  using  models 
available  in  the  PDB,  were  reanalyzed  using  RoseTTAFold 
models: glycine N-acyltransferase (GLYAT) from Bos taurus 
(fig.  S5A),  a  bacterial  oxidoreductase  (fig.  S5B),  a  bacterial 
surface layer protein (SLP) (Fig. 2A) and the secreted protein 
Lrbp from the fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium (Fig. 2B 
and fig. S5C). In all four cases, the predicted models had suf-
ficient structural similarity to the true structures that led to 
successful MR solutions [see methods for details; the per-res-
idue  error  estimates  by  DeepAccNet  (12)  allowed  the  more 
accurate parts to be weighted more heavily]. The increased 
prediction  accuracy  was  critical  for  success  in  all  cases,  as 
models made with trRosetta did not yield MR solutions. 

To determine why the RoseTTAFold models were success-
ful, where PDB structures had previously failed, we compared 
the models to the crystal structures we obtained. The images 
in Fig. 2A and fig. S5 show that in each case, the closest hom-
olog of the known structure was a much poorer model than 
the  RoseTTAFold  model;  in  the  case  of  SLP,  only  a  distant 
model covering part  of the N-terminal domain  (38%  of the 
sequence) was available in the PDB, while no homologs of the 
C-terminal domain of SLP  or any portion of  Lrbp  could be 
detected using HHsearch (13). 

Building atomic models of protein assemblies from cryo-
EM maps can be challenging in the absence of homologs with 
known structures. We used RoseTTAFold to predict the p101 
Gᵦᵧ binding domain (GBD) structure in a heterodimeric PI3Kᵧ 
complex. The top HHsearch hit has a statistically  insignifi-
cant E-value of 40 and only covers 14 residues out of 167 res-
idues.  The  predicted  structure  could  readily  fit  into  the 
electron density map despite the low local resolution [Fig. 2C, 
top; trRosetta failed to predict the correct fold with the same 
MSA  input  (fig.  S6)].  The  Cɑ-RMSD  between  the  predicted 

and the final refined structure is 3.0 Å over the beta-sheets 

(Fig. 2C, bottom). 
 
Providing insights into biological function 
Experimental structure determination can provide consider-
able insight into biological function and mechanism. We in-
vestigated  whether  structures  generated  by  RoseTTAFold 
could  similarly  provide  new  insights  into  function.  We  fo-
cused on two sets of proteins: first, G protein-coupled recep-
tors  of  currently  unknown  structure,  and  second,  a  set  of 
human  proteins  implicated  in  disease.  Benchmark  tests  on 
GPCR  sequences  with  determined  structures  showed  that  
RoseTTAFold models for both active and inactive states can 
be quite accurate even in the absence of close homologs with 
known  structures  [and  better  than  those  in  current  GPCR

model  databases  (14,  15);  fig.  S7]  and  that  the  DeepAccNet 
model quality predictor (12) provides a good measure of ac-
tual  model  accuracy  (fig.  S7D).  We  provide  RoseTTAFold 
models  and  accompanying  accuracy  predictions  for  closed 
and open states of all human GPCRs of currently unknown 
structure. 

Protein structures can provide insight into how mutations 
in key proteins lead to human disease. We identified human 
proteins without close homologs of known structure that con-
tain  multiple  disease-causing  mutations  or  have  been  the 
subject  of  intensive  experimental  investigation  (see  meth-
ods). We used RoseTTAFold to generate models for 693 do-
mains  from  such  proteins.  Over  one-third  of  these  models 
have a predicted lDDT > 0.8, which corresponded to an aver-

age  Cɑ-RMSD  -RMSD  of  2.6 Å  on  CASP14  targets  (fig.  S8). 

Here, we focus on three examples that illustrate the different 
ways in which structure models can provide insight into the 
function or mechanisms of diseases. 

Deficiencies  in  TANGO2  (transport  and  Golgi  organiza-
tion protein 2) lead to metabolic disorders, and the protein 
plays  an  unknown  role  in  Golgi  membrane  redistribution 
into  the  ER  (16,  17).  The  RoseTTAFold  model  of  TANGO2 
adopts an N-terminal nucleophile aminohydrolase (Ntn) fold 
(Fig. 3A) with well-aligned active site residues that are con-
served in TANGO2 orthologs (Fig. 3B). Ntn superfamily mem-
bers  with  structures  similar  to  the  RoseTTAFold  model 
suggest that TANGO2 functions as an enzyme that might hy-
drolyze a carbon-nitrogen bond in a membrane component 
(18). Based on the model, known mutations that cause disease 
(magenta spheres in Fig. 3A) could act by hindering catalysis 
(R26K,  R32Q,  and  L50P,  near  active  site)  or  produce  steric 
clashes (G154R) (19) in the hydrophobic core. By comparison, 
a  homology  model  based  on  very  distant  (<15%  sequence 
identity)  homologs  had  multiple  alignment  shifts  that  mis-
place key conserved residues (fig. S9 and table S3) 

The  ADAM  (A  Disintegrin  And  Metalloprotease)  and 
ADAMTS families of metalloproteases are encoded by over 40 
human  genes,  mediate  cell-cell  and  cell-matrix  interactions 
(20, 21) and are involved in a range of human diseases, in-
cluding cancer metastasis, inflammatory disorders, neurolog-
ical  diseases  and  asthma  (21,  22).  The  ADAMs  contain 
prodomain  and  metalloprotease  domains;  the  fold  of  the  
metalloprotease is known (23, 24), but not that of the prodo-
main,  which  has  no  homologs  of  known  structure.  The  
RoseTTAFold predicted structure of the ADAM33 prodomain 
has a lipocalin-like beta-barrel fold (Fig. 3C) belonging to an 
extended 
includes  metalloprotease  
inhibitors (MPIs) (25). There is a cysteine in an extension fol-
lowing the predicted prodomain barrel; taken together, these 
data  are  consistent  with  experimental  data  suggesting  that 
the ADAM prodomain inhibits metalloprotease activity using 
a  cysteine  switch  (26).  Conserved  residues  within  ADAM33 

superfamily 

that 

orthologs line one side of the barrel and likely interact with 
the metalloprotease (Fig. 3D). 

Transmembrane spanning Ceramide synthase (CERS1) is 
a  key  enzyme  in  sphingolipid  metabolism  which  uses  acyl-
CoA  to  generate  ceramides  with  various  acyl  chain  lengths 
that  regulate  differentiation,  proliferation,  and  apoptosis 
(27). Structure information is not available for any of the CerS 
enzymes or their homologs, and the number and orientation 
of  transmembrane  helices  (TMH)  are  not  known  (28).  The 
RoseTTAFold CERS1 model for residues 98 to 304 (Pfam TLC 
domain) (29) includes six TMH that traverse the membrane 
in an up and down arrangement (Fig. 3E). A central crevice 
extends  into  the  membrane  and  is  lined  with  residues  re-
quired  for  activity  (His182  and  Asp213)  (30)  or  conserved 
(W298), as well as a pathogenic mutation (H183Q) found in 
progressive myoclonus epilepsy and dementia that decreases 
ceramide  levels  (31).  This  active  site  composition  (His182,  
Asp 213, and potentially a neighboring Ser212) suggests test-
able reaction mechanisms for the enzyme (Fig. 3F). 
 
Direct generation of protein-protein complex models 
The final layer of the end-to-end version  of our three-track 
network  generates  3D  structure  models  by  combining  fea-
tures from discontinuous crops of the protein sequence (two 
segments of the protein with a chain break between them). 
We reasoned that because the network can seamlessly handle 
chain breaks, it might be able to predict the structure of pro-
tein-protein complexes directly from sequence information. 
Rather than providing the network the sequence of a single 
protein, with or without possible template structures, two or 
more sequences (and possible templates for these) can be in-
put, with the output the backbone coordinates of two or more 
protein chains. Thus, the network enables the direct building 
of  structure  models  for  protein-protein  complexes  from  se-
quence information, short circuiting the standard procedure 
of building models for individual subunits and then carrying 
out rigid-body docking. In addition to the great reduction in 
compute time required (complex models are generated from 
sequence information in ~30 min on a 24G TITAN RTX GPU), 
this  approach  implements  “flexible  backbone”  docking  al-
most by construction as the structures of the chains are pre-
dicted in the context of each other. We tested the end-to-end 
three-track network on paired sequence alignments for com-
plexes of known structures (32) (see methods and table S4 for 
details) containing two (Fig. 4A) or three (Fig. 4B) chains, and 
in  many  cases,  the  resulting  models  were  very  close  to  the 
actual structures [TM-score (33) > 0.8]. Information on resi-
due-residue co-evolution between the paired sequences likely 
contributes  to  the  accuracy  of  the  rigid  body  placement  as 
more accurate complex structures were generated when more 
sequences were available (fig. S10). The network was trained 
on monomeric proteins, not complexes, so there may be some

training set bias in the monomer structures, but there is none 
for the complexes. 

To illustrate the application of RoseTTAFold to complexes 
of unknown structure with more than three chains, we used 
it  to  generate  models  of  the  complete  four-chain  human  
IL-12R/IL-12 complex (Fig. 4C and fig. S11). A previously pub-
lished cryo-EM map of the IL-12 receptor complex indicated 
a similar topology to that of the IL-23 receptor; however, the 
resolution was not sufficient to observe the detailed interac-
tion  between  IL-12Rβ2  and  IL-12p35  (34).  Such  an  under-
standing  is  important  for  dissecting  the  specific  actions  of  
IL-12  and  IL-23  and  generating  inhibitors  that  block  IL-12 
without impacting IL-23 signaling. The RoseTTAFold model 
fits the experimental cryo-EM density well and identified a 
shared  interaction  between  Y189  in  IL-12p35  and  G115  in  
IL-12Rβ2 analogous to the packing between W156 in IL-23p19 
with G116 in IL-23R. In addition, the model suggests a role 
for the IL-12Rβ2 N-terminal peptide (residue 24-31) in IL-12 
binding  not  observed in the IL-12 cryo-electron microscopy 
(IL-12Rβ2 D26 may interact with nearby K190 and K194 in 
IL-12p35), which may provide an avenue to target the inter-
action between IL-12 and IL-12Rβ2 specifically. 
 
Conclusions 
RoseTTAFold enables solutions of challenging X-ray crystal-
lography and cryo-EM modeling problems, provides insight 
into protein function in the absence of experimentally deter-
mined structures, and rapidly generates accurate models of 
protein-protein complexes. Further training on protein-pro-
tein complex datasets will likely further improve the model-
ing  of  the  structures  of  multiprotein  assemblies.  The 
approach can be readily coupled with existing small molecule 
and protein binder design methodology to improve computa-
tional discovery of new protein and small molecule ligands 
for  targets  of  interest.  The  simultaneous  processing  of  se-
quence,  distance,  and  coordinate  information  by  the  three-
track architecture opens the door to new approaches incor-
porating  constraints  and  experimental  information  at  all 
three levels for problems ranging from cryo-EM structure de-
termination to protein design.

Fig. 1. Network architecture and performance. (A) RoseTTAFold architecture with 1D, 2D, and 3D 
attention  tracks.  Multiple  connections  between  tracks  allow  the  network  to  simultaneously  learn 
relationships within and between sequences, distances, and coordinates (see methods and fig. S1 
for details). (B) Average TM-score of prediction methods on the CASP14 targets. Zhang-server and 
BAKER-ROSETTASERVER were the top 2 server groups while AlphaFold2 and BAKER were the top 
2  human  groups  in  CASP14;  BAKER-ROSETTASERVER  and  BAKER  predictions  were  based  on 
trRosetta. Predictions with the two-track model and RoseTTAFold (both end-to-end and pyRosetta 
version)  were  completely  automated.  (C)  Blind  benchmark  results  on  CAMEO  medium  and  hard 
targets; model accuracies are TM-score values from the CAMEO website (https://cameo3d.org/).

Fig. 2. Enabling experimental structure determination with RoseTTAFold. (A and B) Successful 
molecular replacement with RoseTTAFold models. (A) SLP. (top) C-terminal domain: comparison of 
final  refined  structure  (gray)  to  RoseTTAFold  model  (blue);  there  are  no  homologs  with  known 
structure.  (bottom)  N-terminal  domain:  refined  structure  is  in  gray,  and  RoseTTAFold  model  is 
colored by the estimated RMS error (ranging from blue for 0.67 Å to red for 2 Å or greater). 95 Cɑ 
atoms of the RoseTTAFold model can be superimposed within 3 Å of Cɑ atoms in the final structure, 
yielding a Cɑ-RMSD of 0.98 Å. In contrast, only 54 Cɑ atoms of the closest template (4l3a, brown) can 
be superimposed (with a Cɑ-RMSD of 1.69 Å). (B) Refined structure of Lrbp (gray) with the closest 
RoseTTAFold model (blue) superimposed; residues having estimated RMS error greater than 1.3 Å 
are  omitted  (full  model  is  in  fig.  S5C).  (C)  Cryo-EM  structure  determination  of  p101  Gᵦᵧ  binding 
domain  (GBD)  in  a  heterodimeric  PI3Kᵧ  complex  using  RoseTTAFold.  (top)  RoseTTAFold  models 
colored in a rainbow from the N terminus (blue) to the C terminus (red) have a consistent all-beta 
topology with a clear correspondence to the density map. (bottom) Comparison of the final refined 
structure to the RoseTTAFold model colored by predicted RMS error ranging from blue for 1.5 Å or 
less to red 3 Å or greater. The actual Cɑ-RMSD between the predicted structure and final refined 

structure is 3.0 Å over the beta-sheets. Figure prepared with ChimeraX (35).

Fig.  3.  RoseTTAFold  models  provide  insights  into  function.  (A)  TANGO2  model,  colored  in  a 
rainbow from the N terminus (blue) to the C terminus (red), adopts an Ntn hydrolase fold. Pathogenic 
mutation  sites  are  in  magenta  spheres.  (B)  Predicted  TANGO2  active  site  colored  by  ortholog 
conservation in rainbow  scale  from variable  (blue) to conserved (red) with conserved residues in 
stick and labeled. Pathogenic mutations (spheres with wild-type side chains in the sticks) are labeled 
in magenta; select neighboring residues are depicted in the sticks. (C) ADAM33 prodomain adopts a 
lipocalin-like barrel shown in a rainbow from N terminus (blue) to C terminus  (red). (D) ADAM33 
model surface rendering colored by ortholog conservation from blue (variable) to red (conserved), 
highlighting a conserved surface patch. (E) CERS1 transmembrane structure prediction is colored 
from N terminus (blue) to C terminus (red), with a pathogenic mutation in TMH2 near a central cavity 
in  magenta.  (F)  Zoom  of  CERS1  active  site  with  residues  colored  by  ortholog  conservation  from 
variable  (blue)  to  conserved  (red).  Residues  that  contribute  to  catalysis  (H182  and  D213)  or  are 
conserved (W298 and D213) line the cavity. The conserved pathogenic mutation is adjacent to the 
active site.
